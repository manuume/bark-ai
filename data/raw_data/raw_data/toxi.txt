Cannabis Toxicity in Pets

An Overview
Cannabis generally refers to the products of
the Cannabis sativa plant, commonly known as
marijuana. The Cannabis sativa plant uniquely has
over 100 different chemicals called
phytocannabinoids. (Phyto means plant.) The most
well-known of these is delta 9-tetrahydrocannabinol,
referred to as THC.
THC has psychoactive effects on the brain.
Psychoactive substances are those that affect the
mind or behavior and work on the nervous system,
altering mood and feeling, and making marijuana popular for recreational use. However,
because THC affects many other body systems, it also has many medical uses. Marijuana
has been safely used medically for centuries.
In the United States, the Drug Enforcement Agency (DEA) has classified THC as a
Schedule 1 drug. Schedule 1 drugs have no currently accepted medical use and a high
potential for abuse. Despite this classification, almost all states have legalized marijuana
for either recreational or medical use.
Another cannabinoid found in the Cannabis sativa plant, called cannabidiol (CBD), is also
popular, but because it does not have psychoactive effects, its popularity is primarily due to
its medical benefits.
Marijuana contains at least 1% THC, although this percentage depends on what part of
the plant is used and how it is processed. Products made from marijuana seeds contain
little or no THC, but products made from the plant's buds or flowers can contain up to 10%
THC. In recent years, selective plant breeding has produced levels of THC up to 50%.
The United States government has legalized a different Cannabis sativa plant called
industrial hemp. Hemp can contain no more than 0.3% THC, but it can contain larger
amounts of a second phytocannabinoid, cannabidiol or CBD. Because it contains little
THC, the DEA does not control hemp or its products, and they are not considered illegal
by the federal government. Because it is not illegal, many dietary supplements containing
CBD are now being marketed for medical use in animals.
Keep any medicinal or recreational products out of the reach of pets and
children.
Signs of Marijuana Toxicity in Pets

The legalization of marijuana has led to increased reports of toxicity in dogs and cats.
Most pet exposure to marijuana occurs after eating homemade baked goods containing
the dried marijuana plant (about 70%), followed by eating the plant itself (about 10%).
After ingestion, the time it takes for clinical signs to occur and how long it takes for the pet
to become normal again depend partially on how much marijuana and what else might
have been ingested.
Clinical signs can appear as early as 30 minutes after exposure but may take up to two
hours. After ingestion, pets may become normal again in as little as a couple of hours, but
more often, it takes 24 to 72 hours for pets to return to normal.
It is important to understand that the clinical signs of a pet with marijuana toxicity are very
broad and variable and may be very different for each dog. However, the most common
clinical signs of marijuana toxicity in dogs, listed in order of likelihood and the percentage
of dogs affected are:
• Difficulty walking or standing (88%)
• Increased sensitivity to motion, sound, or touch (for example, easily startled) (75%)
• Lethargy or depression (63%)
• Urine incontinence (dribbling urine) (46%)
• Vomiting (26%)
Less common clinical signs are tremor, twitching or shaking (32%), dilated pupils (22%),
falling over (22%), dazed or minimally responsive (19%). Rarely, the pet may become
aggressive. With the most severe toxicity, seizures may occur, or the pet may become
comatose. Pets that already have an illness may be more likely to become ill. Clinical
signs in these pets may depend on what other illnesses they have.
Compared to humans, a dog has many cannabinoid receptors around the brain that help
with balance. When dogs ingest a large amount of THC, they may become uncoordinated
and unable to stand. This THC side effect in dogs is not likely to occur with CBD or in
other species.
For marijuana toxicity to occur, the pet must eat a large amount of marijuana. The amount
of THC necessary to cause death in a dog or cat has not been determined. We do know
that as much as 3 to 9 g/kg of body weight of THC taken by mouth is not lethal to dogs.
Determining the amount of marijuana that must be eaten before a dog shows signs of
toxicity is also difficult. The least amount of marijuana plant material that has ever been
associated with signs of toxicity in dogs is 3 to 9 g per kg of animal weight (about 1.3 to
4.1 g per lb). For comparison, the average marijuana cigarette weighs about 0.3 to 0.5
grams and contains 0.016 to 0.064 grams of THC.
A problem with dogs ingesting marijuana in baked goods such as brownies or cookies is
that they often contain chocolate, which is also toxic to dogs. Baked products may also
contain concentrated forms of marijuana butter or oil. Another possible reason for
marijuana toxicity in dogs is that marijuana may contain unsafe, illegal substances such
as other drugs or synthetic cannabinoids. In cases where death has been reported in
dogs, the marijuana was most commonly found in baked goods. Chocolate may contain
the sugar substitute xylitol, a toxic substance to dogs.
Diagnosing marijuana toxicity can be difficult. Your veterinarian must be given any
information that might help identify the cause of the clinical signs. Bringing the actual
product your pet was exposed to with you to the clinic can help. Your veterinarian is not
required to report toxicity to local law enforcement.

In humans, urine tests are used to detect chemicals metabolized in urine from THC.
However, animals do not make these metabolites, so these types of urine tests are not
helpful.
How It Works
The phytocannabinoids THC and CBD in Cannabis sativa work through the body’s natural
endocannabinoid system (ECS). (Endo means self.) The chemicals in the ECS interact
with the cannabinoid receptors found throughout the body, helping to regulate physiologic
functions, and may be involved in different diseases. Using drugs to influence this system
may help in the treatment of disease.
The medical effects of THC and CBD differ because they interact differently with the
endocannabinoid system.
In human medicine, CBD has been used to treat anxiety, improve appetite, relieve
nausea, control certain types of seizures, and assist in sleep disorders. In animals, pain
associated with osteoarthritis and seizures associated with epilepsy are common uses of
CBD.
CBD and Supplements
CBD is not psychoactive like THC but may have medical benefits.
CBD is not a scheduled drug by the DEA and is an added ingredient in dietary
supplements sold online, at dispensaries, and available over the counter. THC and CBD
are also available by prescription, and your veterinarian may prescribe one or the other for
treating your pet, most commonly for pain management.
The difference between supplements and prescription drugs is that unapproved products
like supplements are not regulated, nor are they assessed for consistency. Supplement
labels may inaccurately list the amount of CBD in the product. More importantly,
supplements may contain chemicals such as synthetic cannabinoids that are not listed on
the label but may be dangerous to your pet.
In general, marijuana is safe. People are generally exposed to higher amounts of THC
than pets because people more commonly smoke, rather than ingest, marijuana. THC that
is ingested (for example, in human marijuana edible products) is removed mainly by the
liver before it can get into the blood. THC that is inhaled bypasses the liver, and most of it
enters the blood.
Toxicity in THC vs CBD
Because of its psychogenic effects, products containing THC are more likely to cause
clinical signs that look like toxicity in dogs or cats. However, in contrast to marijuana or
THC, products containing CBD have not been associated with significant toxicity or side
effects in dogs. The toxicity or side effects of Cannabis most likely reflect the effects of
THC rather than CBD, but are rarely lethal.
In cases in which side effects were reported with a supplement containing CBD, the
supplement also contained THC. Even then, the side effects involved the gastrointestinal
tract (vomiting, diarrhea) and were not severe.
An exception is those products that contain synthetic cannabinoids or if other drugs have
been unknowingly added. These products can be life-threatening. This is another reason
that it is important to bring the actual product to your veterinarian.
Different cannabinoids have varied effects, and each may reach a different area of the
body. Responses to CBD among animals may reflect the differences in individual
endocannabinoid systems.
Treatment for Toxicity

Diagnosis and treatment of marijuana toxicity depend on a well-informed veterinarian.
There is no specific antidote for marijuana toxicity. Treatments are given to help control
the clinical signs. This might include IV fluids or drugs to control vomiting and, for severe
toxicity, antiseizure medications.
Usually, the patient is sent home after a physical examination. The pet can be kept in a
confined space and monitored until the effects wear off. However, more intense in-hospital
observation and support are needed if the patient has lost consciousness.
If less than 30 minutes have passed since the Cannabis has been eaten, it may be
possible to induce vomiting. However, the pet may inhale stomach contents, particularly if
it is acting sedated. This option may be necessary if the pet ingested a life-threatening
toxin.
In more severe cases of toxicity, your veterinarian may give activated charcoal orally. This
liquid helps to bind ingested toxins. The toxin passes along with the charcoal when the pet
defecates. However, this should not be given to sedated patients.
Cannabinoids might interact with other medications. For example, they may cause other
medications to leave the body more slowly. It is important to notify your veterinarian if your
pet is receiving Cannabis or any supplement.

Alcohol Poisoning
Becky Lundgren, DVM
Revised: February 18, 2020
Published: July 04, 2005
Dogs and cats can get more than just drunk when
they drink ethanol, isopropanol, or methanol -- they
can get a trip to the emergency room. Pets can die
from ingesting alcohol.
What are ethanol, isopropanol, and methanol?
Ethanol (ethyl alcohol) is most commonly formed
from the fermentation of sugars. Ethanol is found in
alcoholic beverages, some liquid medications and
mouthwash bases, rotting/fermenting fruits, and
rising (raw) yeast-containing bread dough. The
“proof” of ethanol is twice the percentage of alcohol
concentration (i.e. 80 proof = 40% ethanol).
Although ethanol is also in some household inks,
cleaners, and solvents, the levels are low enough
to generally be of no clinical significance if these
products are ingested by pets.
Isopropanol (isopropyl alcohol) is in rubbing
alcohol (70%), some anti-freezes, some detergents, glass/window cleaners,
perfumes/colognes, and alcohol-based topical sprays, including some pet flea-control and
grooming products. Isopropyl alcohol is more than twice as potent as ethanol or methanol.
Methanol (methyl alcohol, wood alcohol) is most commonly found in automotive
windshield washer fluids (20-80%) but is also in some gasoline additives, “canned heat”
fuels (e.g., Sterno®), and some household solvents (e.g., paint removers).
Although the strength of these three alcohols varies, the clinical signs associated with
their ingestion by dogs and cats are quite similar.
All poisoning problems boil down to the amount of alcohol ingested compared to weight,
just like a dosage of medicine. Thus, when pets drink an alcoholic beverage that was left
within reach or that was given to them intentionally by someone, it can cause a significant
toxicity problem. In addition, significant absorption can occur through the skin or by
inhalation.
Dogs are highly susceptible to the effects of alcohol. Signs of mild inebriation may occur
with even minor exposure. Within 15 to 30 minutes after the pet has drunk the alcohol on
an empty stomach (or within 1 to 2 hours on a full stomach), central nervous system
(CNS) signs, such as staggering, excitement, or decreased reflexes, can begin.
Behavioral changes can be seen, as can an increased need to urinate. As the problem
gets worse, the pet may become depressed, have a slow respiratory rate, or go into
cardiac arrest. Puppies and kittens are at particular risk because of their small size and
immature organ systems.

Alcohols are depressants, so many of the clinical signs associated with them are due to
their effect on the CNS. Alcohols irritate the gastrointestinal tract. They also act as
diuretics, and the alcohol and its metabolites are eliminated by the kidneys. Liver damage
may occur after exposure, although it is much more common in animals that have
repeated or chronic exposure.
Clinical Signs
Clinical signs of intoxication can occur within 15-30 minutes of ingestion of alcohol. Signs
include nausea, vomiting, thirst, urination, dehydration, lethargy, incoordination,
disorientation, becoming cold (hypothermia), low blood pressure, and alcoholic bad
breath. In severe cases, blindness, tremors, tetraplegia, respiratory depression, coma, or
seizures may develop. Death is uncommon but may occur, especially if the pet has severe
respiratory and cardiovascular depression, low blood pressure, and/or hypoglycemia.
Diagnosis
Diagnosis is based on a history of exposure, combined with appropriate clinical signs and
laboratory tests.
Treatment/Management/Prevention
The treatments your veterinarian may use can include assisted ventilation, intravenous
fluids (to improve elimination of the alcohol/metabolites, to provide cardiovascular support,
and to correct electrolyte abnormalities), seizure control, and other supportive therapies.
In addition, if the alcohol toxicosis is due to the ingestion of bread dough, your veterinarian
may need to wash out your pet's stomach with cold water to inhibit further alcohol
production and to break up the dough mass for removal. In addition, your pet will be
confined to prevent accidental self-injury.
Prognosis
Most dogs with alcohol intoxication can recover with adequate symptomatic and
supportive care. Recovery may take 8-12 hours and tends to take longer if it was a severe
intoxication or if isopropanol was involved.
Preventing Alcohol Toxicosis
All alcoholic beverages and alcohol-containing fluids should be kept out of reach of your
dogs and cats. Consult your veterinarian before giving any ethanol-containing liquid
medications.
Do not feed raw bread dough to your pets or leave it out to rise in areas that they can
reach. Always dispose of discarded bread dough carefully.

Chocolate Toxicity in Dogs
Wendy Brooks, DVM, DABVP
Revised: August 13, 2023
Published: November 22, 2004
Chocolate may be America’s favorite flavor.
We like chocolate candy, ice cream,
chocolate drinks, chocolate cakes, and just
about anything with chocolate. We may want
to share our favorite treat with an eager pet
but it is best to think twice and reach for the
dog biscuits instead.
Different Types of Chocolate and How They
Are Made
Anyone who has ever eaten candy knows
there are many types of chocolate: milk,
dark, white, unsweetened, cocoa powder,
etc. It turns out each type has a different
potential for toxicity. In order to understand which types of chocolates are more toxic, we
will need to review how chocolate is made.
Cocao trees, which require a tropical climate, are farmed in orchards like any other fruitbearing tree. The fruit of the cacao tree, called a cacao pod, is sweet and attracts
monkeys or other wildlife who eat the fruit but not the bitter seeds. The seeds are
discarded in the natural setting, allowing new trees to grow. Outside of the farm situation,
the seeds cannot be released from the fruit unless some type of animal breaks the fruit
open. Ironically, it is the bitter seeds, packed with theobromine and caffeine, which are
used to make chocolate.
The pods grow directly off the trunk of the cacao tree and must be harvested by hand so
as not to damage the tree. The pods are split, and the seeds are scooped out and left to
ferment under banana leaves for about a week. This process turns the cocoa seeds into
the rich brown color with which we are familiar and creates the chocolate flavor we crave.
The seeds are then dried out for another week, packed in sacks, and shipped to chocolate
manufacturers. The seeds must be roasted, ground, pressed to remove the seed oil (this
oil is called cocoa butter, which is used in sunscreens, white chocolate, and cosmetics,
among other things), and finally tempered to create the exact consistency.
Chocolate liquor is the liquid that results from grinding the hulled cacao beans.
Cocoa butter is the fat that is extracted from chocolate liquor. It is combined
with sugar and flavoring to create white chocolate. White chocolate is not
directly toxic as it has no chocolate liquor, but its rich fat content can be a
problem, as discussed below.
Cocoa powder is the solid that remains after the cocoa butter is removed from
the chocolate liquor. The powder can be treated with alkali in a process called

Dutching, or it can be left alone. Note the low-fat nature of cocoa powder,
hence its use in low-fat baking.
Unsweetened (baking) chocolate is basically straight chocolate liquor
containing 50% to 60% cocoa butter.
Dark chocolate (also known as semisweet chocolate) is chocolate that is 35%
chocolate liquor (the rest being sugar, vanilla, or lecithin).
Milk chocolate is chocolate that is at least 10% chocolate liquor, the rest being
milk solids, vanilla, or lecithin.
Chocolate liquor is the one with all the problem biochemicals. The more
chocolate liquor is in the end product (i.e., how dark the chocolate is), the more
toxic it is.
Pancreatitis
Sometimes we eat chocolate plain, as in candy. Sometimes we eat it baked into cakes,
mixed into ice cream, etc. Sometimes we share these treats with pets, and sometimes,
our pets share these treats without our permission. As far as pets are concerned, the first
potential problem with these sweets is the fat. A sudden high-fat meal (such as
demolishing a bag of chocolate bars left accessible at Halloween time) can create a lethal
metabolic disease in dogs called pancreatitis. Vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain are
just the beginning of this disaster. Remember, in the case of pancreatitis, it is the fat that
causes the problem more than the chocolate itself.
The fat and sugar in the chocolate can create an unpleasant but temporary upset
stomach. This is what happens in most chocolate ingestion cases.
Theobromine and Caffeine
Chocolate is, however, directly toxic because it contains
methylxanthines. In particular, the methylxanthines
chocolate contains are theobromine and caffeine. Both
caffeine and theobromine produce similar effects, with the
theobromine effects lasting much longer than the
caffeine. The more chocolate liquor there is in a product,
the more theobromine there is. This makes baking
chocolate the worst for pets, followed by semisweet and
dark chocolate, followed by milk chocolate, followed by
chocolate-flavored cakes or cookies.
Theobromine causes:
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Hyperactivity
Tremors
Seizures
Racing heart rhythm progressing to abnormal rhythms
Death in severe cases
Toxic doses of theobromine are 9 mg per pound of the dog’s weight for mild signs and up
to 18 mg per pound for severe signs. Milk chocolate contains 44 mg per ounce of
theobromine, semisweet chocolate contains 150 mg per ounce, and baking chocolate
contains 390 mg per ounce. White chocolate has virtually no theobromine and is only a
problem because of its fat content. These calculations seem complex, and they certainly
can be. What it boils down to is that your veterinarian will need to know the type of

chocolate and how many ounces were most likely consumed. If it is not clear how much
chocolate was actually consumed, the largest possible amount should be determined
based on how much candy, cake, etc., is missing.
It takes nearly four days for the effects of chocolate to work its way out of a dog’s system.
If the chocolate was only just eaten, it is possible to induce vomiting; otherwise,
hospitalization and support are needed. It is common for clinics to receive phone calls
about pets who were found to have consumed a chocolate product, and the owner wishes
to know if the amount was toxic. In order to answer such questions, it is necessary to
know the pet's weight, the type of chocolate, and the amount of chocolate. Chocolate
calculators are available at most veterinary practices, and it can be determined relatively
quickly if the pet should be made to vomit immediately.
Treatment
As mentioned, the first step is to remove as much chocolate from the body as possible by
inducing vomiting or using adsorbents such as activated charcoal to bind the chocolate
and keep it from being absorbed by the GI tract. For many patients, removing undigested
chocolate converts the toxicity from neurologic poisoning to just an upset stomach that is
easily managed. If too much caffeine/theobromine has been absorbed, the treatment is
support: sedation for the tremors and intravenous medications for any cardiac
arrhythmias. Support is needed until the toxins have been processed and removed from
the body so expect severe cases to need intravenous fluid support and hospitalization for
a few days.
An ounce of prevention is worth a pound of cure. Keep chocolate treats where
your pet cannot reach them.

Chocolate Toxicity Signs in Dogs
Tony Johnson, DVM, DACVECC
Revised: December 19, 2019
Published: February 05, 2014
Most pet owners know that chocolate is bad for dogs and
can cause significant problems for a dog; cats are usually
too finicky to eat it. But what signs of chocolate toxicity
should you look for when you know your dog ate
chocolate, and what should you do?
Signs to Watch For
The active ingredient in chocolate that causes problems
with dogs is called theobromine, which is a distant cousin
of caffeine.
Some of the signs are caused by excitation to the nervous
system, like a caffeine overdose. Look for:
Nervousness/restlessness
Twitching
Panting
Seizures in severe cases
Just ingesting chocolate, which most dogs don’t typically eat every day, can cause an
upset stomach. In these cases, you can see:
Vomiting
Diarrhea
Abdominal pain
Lack of appetite
If you notice any symptoms after your dog eats chocolate, it's best to have them evaluated
by a veterinarian or emergency clinic quickly. The theobromine can also cause a
dangerously rapid heart rate and high blood pressure, both of which may require
treatment.
What to Do
A small amount of milk chocolate, like the amount found in a chocolate chip cookie, is not
a problem.
For larger, recent exposures, just getting your dog to vomit the chocolate is enough. Your
veterinarian or local emergency clinic can help you with this, so call them if your dog has
ingested chocolate. They can help you decide when, how, and where to induce vomiting
and if further therapy is needed. In cases where a dog is showing signs of chocolate
toxicity, they can also start treatment and contact an animal poison control center for
guidance.

Electronic Cigarettes are Toxic to Pets
Sharon M. Gwaltney-Brant, DVM, PhD, DABT, DABVT
Published: March 31, 2014
Electronic cigarettes, often called e-cigs, are marketed as an alternative to cigarette
smoking. They are also referred to as personal vaporizers or electronic nicotine delivery
systems. These devices have a cylindrical body that holds a cartridge containing a liquid
solution; some resemble tobacco cigarettes. The solution, termed “e-liquid” or “e-juice,”
contains a base material, flavoring compounds, and nicotine. The base material is
generally propylene glycol and either vegetable glycerin or polyethylene glycol.
Glycerin and propylene glycol are of low
toxicity when eaten, but the amount in the
refill bottles (usually 10-30% of what's in the
bottle) is low enough to not be much of a
concern; nicotine is the bigger issue.
Whether any of the compounds used are
toxic if inhaled long term is not known.
The nicotine levels in these e-liquids can
vary in concentration from being completely
nicotine-free up to 36 milligrams per milliliter
(mg/mL) of nicotine. For marketing
purposes, the “/mL” part is frequently
dropped, and the e-liquids are advertised as
having X mg of nicotine rather than X
mg/mL. In some e-cigs, the user controls the
amount of nicotine delivered by adjusting the
flow of e-liquid from the cartridge.
An e-cig with a full cartridge can contain up
to 36 mg of nicotine, which doesn’t sound
like a lot until you factor in how toxic nicotine
is. Clinical signs of nicotine poisoning can
be seen in dogs and cats exposed to a mere
0.5 mg per pound of body weight. For cats
and small dogs, ingesting 20 mg of nicotine
can be lethal.
Even more dangerous are the bottles of eliquid that are used to recharge the e-cig
cartridge: the nicotine in these bottles can
range from 10 mL to 60 mL or more. So a 30-mL bottle of 36 mg/mL e-liquid will contain
1080 mg of nicotine, more than enough to prove fatal for even a very large dog if the
contents are ingested.
Nicotine is readily absorbed by ingestion as
well as through the skin. Pets may be
exposed when they chew up the e-cigs or

the bottles containing e-juice or even when
they walk through puddles of spilled e-juice
and get it on their paws. The signs of
nicotine poisoning may begin within 15 to 30
minutes of exposure to the e-liquid; in
contrast, signs of nicotine poisoning
following eating tobacco products may take
a few hours as the nicotine must be released
from the tobacco.
The first signs normally seen with toxic
exposure to nicotine include:
Excessive drooling (hypersalivation)
Vomiting with or without diarrhea
Agitation or restlessness
Increased respiratory rate or panting.
With severe intoxications, signs may progress to include:
Excitation
Disorientation
Tremors
Twitching
Convulsions or seizures
Increased heart rate
Increased blood pressure.
Further progression of signs may result in profound weakness, paralysis, abnormal heart
rhythms (including cardiac arrest), hypotension, coma, and death.
Prompt and aggressive veterinary care is required to successfully manage poisoning from
e-juice exposure. Because the e-juice is rapidly absorbed across the mucous membranes
of the mouth, standard decontamination measures such as inducing vomiting are usually
not helpful. Treatment includes managing convulsions and seizures, treating heart and
blood pressure abnormalities, ensuring adequate respiration, and providing intravenous
fluids to enhance nicotine elimination.
The prognosis for patients exposed to large amounts of nicotine can be quite grave
depending on how quickly veterinary care is obtained, and even with aggressive
veterinary care, some patients will not survive.

Nicotine Poisoning in Pets
Wendy Brooks, DVM, DABVP
Revised: January 27, 2023
Published: July 23, 2004
Everyone knows the Surgeon General’s
warning about cigarette smoking but what
about cigarette eating?
Nicotine poisoning is a real concern anywhere
that a pet may find cigarettes, cigarette butts,
chewing tobacco, nicotine gum, patches, or ecigarettes. Dogs, particularly puppies, tend to
chew things up first and ask questions later.
Cats may find a cigarette butt to be a nicely
sized pouncing toy worthy of chewing.
Luckily for pets and small children, tobacco
tastes terrible. Even chewing tobacco must
have flavorings added to make it worthy of oral
enjoyment. Still, cigarettes have plenty of
nicotine and even a small cigarette butt can
mean serious illness or even death for a small
pet.
The toxic dose for nicotine in pets is 0.5 to one
mg per pound of pet body weight while the lethal dose is four mg per pound of pet body
weight. So how does this translate to nicotine-containing products? A cigarette contains
between 9 & 30 mg of nicotine depending on the type of cigarette. When the cigarette is
smoked, the nicotine concentrates down in the oral end meaning that a small nub of a
cigarette butt will retain 25% of the nicotine contained in the original cigarette. Smoking a
cigarette yields 0.5-2.0 mg of nicotine to the smoker but eating the cigarette (or other
nicotine product) is a whole different ballgame as all of the nicotine becomes available for
absorption into the body. Consider that a 2-lb dog would only need 10 mg of nicotine to
become poisoned and a 40-lb dog would need only 1cc (less than a quarter teaspoon) of
e-juice.
Cigarettes: 9-30 mg of nicotine
Cigarette butts: 2-8 mg of nicotine
Cigars: up to 40 mg of nicotine
Chewing tobacco: 6-8 mg of nicotine per gram
Nicotine gum: 2-4 mg of nicotine per piece
Nicotine patches: 8.3-114 mg of nicotine
E-cigarette cartridges: 6-36 mg of nicotine
E-juice/E-fluid (to refill E-cigarettes): up to 36 mg of nicotine per ml

Some good news is that nicotine is not
absorbed directly in the acid environment of
the stomach; the nicotine must move past the
stomach into the small intestine for absorption.
One of the first things nicotine does in the
body is to stimulate the vomiting center of the
brain, thus inducing vomiting that may save the
patient’s life if there is more cigarette material
in the stomach.
Symptoms of Nicotine Poisoning
Signs begin as quickly as one hour postingestion. Symptoms include:
Tremors
Constricted pupils
Drooling
Auditory and visual hallucinations
Excitement
Vomiting and diarrhea
Twitching, possibly progressing to seizures
Racing heart rate but slow heart rate with small doses
High blood pressure but at higher doses, there is a circulatory collapse
It is easy to confuse nicotine poisoning with other poisonings such as strychnine,
chocolate, organophosphate insecticides, and certain molds. Hopefully, there will be
cigarette materials in the vomit to give away the diagnosis. It is also worth mentioning that
some nicotine gums contain xylitol as a sweetener. This material is toxic to dogs and can
add an entirely new dimension to nicotine poisoning.
Treatment
If not too much time (an hour or so) has passed since consumption of the nicotine
product, vomiting can be induced. Washing out the stomach to get rid of any remaining
cigarette materials is helpful but is likely to require sedation as well as activated charcoal
to bind the nicotine and prevent it from entering the body. Obviously, this would be
performed at the veterinarian's office.
Treatment is basically supportive after that. Intravenous fluids support circulation while the
body gets rid of the nicotine. If seizures or tremors are occurring, medications will be
needed to suppress them. If the pet survives the first four hours, the prognosis is felt to
be good. Nicotine is inactivated by a healthy liver and its metabolites are excreted in the
urine. After 16 hours, the nicotine ingested should be gone.
The ASPCA National Animal Poison Control is available 24 hours a day at 888-426-
4435. Expect an initial consultation fee of around $100.00 and additional follow-up is
at no charge. You will be assigned a case number your veterinarian can use to

Salmon Poisoning in Dogs
Becky Lundgren, DVM
Revised: December 09, 2020
Published: November 08, 2010
Salmon poisoning is also known as salmon disease, salmon poisoning disease (SPD), and
Neorickettsia helminthoeca infection. It is an acute, and often fatal, infectious disease of
dogs, coyotes, and foxes of the Pacific Northwest. This disease has been found in black
bears and Malayan sun bears, but has not been reported in cats.
Despite its name, salmon poisoning does not involve a toxin. Salmon poisoning is an
infection that develops when dogs eat raw or undercooked fish (salmon, trout, or
steelhead) or Pacific Giant Salamanders that contain a fluke. A fluke, also known as a
trematode, is an internal parasite. In this case, the fluke is Nanophyetus
salmincola that contains a rickettsial organism called Neorickettsia helminthoeca.
Once the larval flukes reach the dog's intestinal tract, they embed in the dog's duodenal
mucosa, and release the rickettsiae. The rickettsial organisms then spread through the
bloodstream to the liver, lungs, brain, and lymphoid tissue. Clinical signs include, but are not
limited to: fever; nausea; vomiting; bloody diarrhea; weight loss; ascites; nasal and eye
discharge; enlarged lymph nodes; tachypnea; dyspnea; tachycardia; twitching; and
seizures. Approximately 60 percent of cases have generalized lymph node enlargement.
Unless the infection is treated, 50 – 90% of affected animals will die of the infection within
7 to 10 days.
Clinical signs usually begin about one week after the animal eats the infected raw fish,
although delays of 33 days have been reported.
Geographic Distribution
Although infected fish can be found in the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to the coast of
Alaska, salmon poisoning is most commonly found in Washington, Oregon, northern
California, and southern Vancouver Island (Canada). It is also seen inland, along the rivers
of fish migration. The Pacific Northwest has the trematode's first intermediate host, a small
snail called Oxytrema plicifer.
Diagnosis
Although clinical signs are caused by the rickettsial organisms and not the fluke,
presumptive diagnosis is usually made by identifying the fluke’s ova (eggs) in the feces.
Ova are identified in 92% of cases. Direct smears of fecal material usually provide sufficient
specimens for diagnosis, although other methods can be used.
Lymph node cytology and histopathology may provide a more definitive diagnosis, if
necessary.
A history of access to raw fish also aids in diagnosis.
Treatment

To combat the hemorrhage, necrosis, and infection, affected animals usually need
antibiotics, fluid therapy, blood transfusions, antiemetics, antidiarrheals, and anticestodals
(drugs that kill flukes).
Prognosis
Many dogs respond well to antibiotic therapy, and resolution of gastrointestinal signs, fever,
and thrombocytopenia can occur within 24-72 hours of starting therapy. However, if
treatment is not started, death can occur 7-10 days after the onset of clinical signs. In one
report, overall mortality rate was 14%. In another study of 43 dogs that were treated with
antibiotics, 39 survived.
Preventive Measures
Dogs should not be allowed to eat raw or smoked-raw fish (salmon, trout, steelhead), or
Pacific Giant Salamanders.
Dogs that survive salmon poisoning will be immune to re-infection with the same strain.
However, infection with an alternate strain can occur because there is no cross-protection.

The Wrath of Grapes
Charlotte Means, DVM, DABVT (Pharmacology/Toxicology), DABT (Pharmacology/Toxicology)
Revised: October 04, 2024
Published: February 27, 2014
Magoo was a big, playful Labrador retriever who
often got himself into some sticky situations.
Usually, his escapades were harmless. But one day,
he managed to snag a box of raisins from the
pantry and ended up eating an entire pound of the
sweet treats. Other than being exasperated by
Magoo's behavior, his guardians didn't think much
about it. They knew that lots of people shared
grapes with their dogs and often used raisins as
training rewards. So it hardly seemed the kind of
emergency that required a call to the veterinarian.
In fact, if Magoo's parents had called the ASPCA's
Animal Poison Control Center (APCC) just a few years ago, they would have been told not
to worry about it.
Through the Grapevine
Enter the APCC AnTox database, a computerized system that contains nearly 500,000
animal-related medical conditions and that enables veterinarians to quickly identify toxic
substance exposures, recognize clinical signs, and administer proper treatment. By
tracking cases in this registry, similarities in animal medical conditions nationwide can be
logged and syndromes can be identified.
Around 1999, the APCC began noticing a trend in dogs who had eaten grapes or raisins:
Nearly all developed acute renal (kidney) failure. As more cases were reported, enough
data was generated in the database to help veterinarians identify and treat dogs at risk. In
all of the cases, the ingredients for potential acute renal failure were the same. Whether
the ingested grapes were purchased fresh from grocery stores or grown in private yards
didn't seem to matter, nor did the brand eaten. And the ingested amounts varied
considerably, from over a pound of grapes to as little as a single serving of raisins. The
cases weren't from any specific region, but instead came from across the United States.
The database showed that dogs who ate the grapes and raisins typically vomited within a
few hours of ingestion. Most of the time, partially digested grapes and raisins could be
seen in the vomit, fecal material, or both. At this point, some dogs would stop eating
(anorexia), and develop diarrhea. The dogs often became quiet and lethargic, and showed
signs of abdominal pain. These clinical signs lasted for several days -- sometimes even
weeks.
When medical care was sought, blood chemistry panels showed consistent patterns.
Hypercalcemia (elevated blood calcium levels) was present, as well as elevated levels of
blood urea nitrogen, creatinine, and phosphorous (substances that tell your veterinarian
about your pet's kidney function). These blood work values began to increase anywhere
from 24 hours to several days after the dogs ate the fruit. As the kidney damage

developed, the dogs would produce little urine. When they could no longer produce urine,
death occurred. In some cases, dogs who received timely veterinary care still had to be
euthanized.
Why Did the Fruit Cause Illness?
There are still many unknowns. Suspect grapes and raisins have been screened for
various pesticides, heavy metals (such as zinc or lead), and mycotoxins (fungal
contaminants) and so far, all results have come back negative. In cases where the grapes
were grown in private yards, owners confirmed that no insecticides, fertilizers, or
antifungals had been used on the fruit.
Tartaric acid, a chemical found in grapes and raisins, was shown to contribute to the
kidney damage seen with intoxication in one study. However, more studies are needed to
prove or refute this theory.
"Raisin" the Success Rate
Even though the exact cause of renal failure is unknown, dogs who ingest grapes and
raisins can be treated successfully to prevent its development. The first line of defense is
decontamination. Inducing vomiting in recent ingestions and administering activated
charcoal helps prevent the absorption of potential toxins. Dogs should be hospitalized and
placed on intravenous fluids for at least 48 hours. A veterinarian should monitor blood
chemistry daily for at least three days following the ingestion. If all blood work is normal
after three days, it's unlikely that kidney failure will occur. If a dog shows evidence of renal
failure, fluids must be continued, and other medications should be used to stimulate urine
production. Some dogs may need peritoneal dialysis, a process where the peritoneum
(the membranes surrounding the abdominal organs) is used to filter waste products that
are normally filtered by the kidney.
Thanks in part to the AnTox database, grape or raisin ingestion can be easily identified
and treated. Today, a dog can make a complete recovery from this potentially fatal
condition.

Yeast Dough Dangers in Pets
Elizabeth Riley, Veterinary Student Class of 2023
Reviewed by the Veterinary Team at VIN
Published: May 27, 2021
If you bake yeast bread from scratch, it is
essential that you keep all raw bread dough
away from your pets. Ingesting it can cause
serious problems and be life threatening for
your pet.
Doughs that do not contain yeast are less of
a concern, but can still cause gastrointestinal
problems.
Why is it so dangerous to eat?
Yeast is a microscopic fungus that, under the
right conditions, makes carbon dioxide gas
and ethanol (alcohol) from sugar. This effect
is great for making bread because gas
makes the dough rise and ethanol flavors the bread before burning off in the oven.
However, this process is dangerous when it occurs in your animal's stomach.
Being moist and warm, the stomach is essentially the perfect environment for yeast to
grow and pump out carbon dioxide and ethanol. The buildup of gas and rising dough in
the stomach is painful and can lead to a condition called bloat: “the mother of all
emergencies.” Also known as gastric dilatation and volvulus, or GDV, bloat is where the
expanding stomach puts pressure on surrounding areas and decreases blood flow to
important organs. Even more dangerous, the stomach may eventually twist, cutting off
blood flow even more. The twisted stomach can reduce blood flow throughout the whole
body, leading to a serious condition called shock.
Several steps are needed to save a bloated dog’s life. Part of the problem is that the main
three steps - decompress the stomach, give IV fluids to fight shock, and stabilize the heart
rhythm - should all be done at the same time and as quickly as possible.
Although GDV can be life threatening, death from yeast dough in pets is usually due to the
effects of ethanol. Ethanol is alcohol, like that found in beer, wine and spirits, so the
ethanol produced by yeast can cause alcohol poisoning. This poisoning can lead to low
blood sugar, low blood pressure, decreased body temperature, seizures and trouble
breathing.
Signs
Early signs of yeast dough ingestion are generally those associated with bloat. Your pet
may try to vomit or retch but not produce anything or maybe just a little white foam.
Additional signs include an enlarged abdomen due to the buildup of gas and dough, in
addition to weakness, increased heart rate, and collapse.

Signs of alcohol poisoning generally occur two or more hours after dough is ingested. You
might be able to smell alcohol on your pet's breath. Your pet may seem drunk, becoming
uncoordinated and disoriented. They may also feel cold to the touch. Seizures and trouble
breathing are two other serious signs of alcohol poisoning.
What should I Do?
Get to a veterinarian as soon as possible, as this is potentially a life-threatening
emergency.
If your pet just recently ate the dough and isn't showing any symptoms yet, your
veterinarian may try to induce vomiting to remove it from the stomach. As you can
imagine, bread dough is so gummy and sticky that it is hard to vomit up. So, other
methods of removal will likely be necessary.
Yeast love the warmth in a stomach. If you make the stomach cold, you can slow the
yeast's growth and the production of alcohol and gas. This slow down can be
accomplished by feeding ice chips or flushing the stomach with cold water. These
treatments can also break up the dough and make it easier to pass through the rest of the
digestive system. In rare cases, the dough may need to be surgically removed.
Treatment also involves dealing with your pet's specific clinical signs and may entail giving
intravenous fluids to correct any blood abnormalities and to speed up removing alcohol
from the bloodstream. If your pet is cold, heating blankets, warm intravenous fluids and
other techniques may be used to warm them up. Depending on your pet's symptoms,
medications may be given to reduce pain, treat seizures, correct breathing abnormalities,
manage vomiting, etc.
The veterinarian will need to monitor your pet for at least 12 hours until they recover.
Prognosis
Pets generally do well if the yeast dough is removed quickly and they are treated soon
after ingestion. Unfortunately, pets suffering from severe alcohol poisoning, bloat, or GDV
have a more guarded prognosis.
To prevent this life-threatening situation altogether, avoid letting your pets have access to
raw yeast dough by letting it rise in areas your pets can't reach, such as elevated places in
the kitchen, or in a closed oven or microwave.
