Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation (DIC) in Dogs and
Cats
Wendy Brooks, DVM, DABVP
Revised: January 20, 2021
Published: March 30, 2009
Disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC)
is an extreme complication of numerous
already life-threatening conditions leading to
the deregulation of the body’s natural
mechanisms of blood clotting and blood clot
dissolving. In other words, a really sick
patient begins both bleeding and clotting
abnormally at the same time, leading to
disaster and frequently to death. DIC is a
disease of the blood.
Setting the Scene for DIC
The patient must already have a serious
problem before DIC sets in. Typical
conditions that are associated with DIC
include those involving dying internal tissue,
widespread inflammation, red blood cell
destruction, poor circulation, particulate matter in the bloodstream, or loss of blood vessel
integrity.
The following conditions are associated with disseminated intravascular coagulation:
Pancreatitis
Rattlesnake bite
Immune mediated hemolytic anemia
Immune mediated platelet destruction (thrombocytopenia)
Hemangiosarcoma
Blood transfusion reaction
Severe liver failure
Overwhelming infection (sepsis)
Crushing injury
Heatstroke
Protein-losing enteropathy
Glomerular disease
Heartworm disease
Cushing's disease
DIC is primarily a canine problem but can occur in cats. The usual underlying causes in
feline patients are lymphoma, hepatic lipidosis, and feline infectious peritonitis.

In the normal body, there are small bleeds occurring regularly as we bump into things or
cut ourselves. Blood clots patch these small blood vessel tears up and as healing takes
place other blood mechanisms dissolve the old clots leaving scar tissue.
In DIC, the normal clotting mechanism is exaggerated. In the normal body, a substance
called antithrombin (formerly called antithrombin III) is involved in dissolving old blood
clots but in the event of exaggerated clotting, antithrombin becomes prematurely depleted.
There are other anti-clotting proteins that are also depleted by the exaggerated clotting
state. The result of this depletion is an excess of fibrin, the material of which blood clots
are made.
Active proteins involved in the manufacture of fibrin stimulate the blood vessel cells to
release inflammatory biochemicals (note: the patient likely started with a disease involving
widespread inflammation). Ultimately, there is both inappropriate clotting and bleeding at
the same time.
Recognizing DIC
The sooner DIC is recognized, the more likely the chance of a positive outcome. At first,
there are no signs at all, just subtle blood test changes. It is important for the medical staff
to watch for these lab changes in patients known to have diseases associated with DIC.
There are several factors that go into the diagnosis of DIC and a patient need not have
them all:
Low platelet count
Platelets are the white blood cell fragments that are involved in normal blood clotting. In
DIC, they are depleted.
Evidence of inappropriate bleeding
This could be bruising in the skin, excessive
bleeding after a blood sample is taken, or
spontaneous bleeding from the gums or from
any orifice.
Increases in blood clotting times
Tests called the PT and PTT are run to
assess how long different blood clotting
proteins take to produce a blood clot. These
times are compared to standardized normal
times. Increased clotting times indicate a
tendency to bleed inappropriately. Clotting
times well below the normal range can
indicate a hypercoagulable state.
Presence of fibrin degradation products (sometimes called fibrin split products)
Fibrin is the material that clots are made of. When antithrombin and other biochemicals
remove clots, fibrin fragments become detectable. These are fibrin degradation products.
A fibrin degradation product of note is called the D-Dimer. It is notable because there are
in-hospital test kits that can be used to detect it. The presence of D-dimer definitely
indicates that a clot has been made and broken down (though, there are many reasons for
such a thing to have occurred other than DIC). A negative D-dimer test rules out DIC with
95 percent confidence.
The absence of D-Dimer rules out DIC with 95% confidence in dogs but is less
reliable in cats.
Reduced fibrinogen blood levels
Fibrinogen is a fibrin precursor and the absence of it suggests that it is depleted. The use
of fibrinogen reduction as a marker for DIC has been questioned because there are

numerous other factors that can reduce fibrinogen.
A Special Note on Thromboelastography (TEG Testing)
In this kind of testing, a gadget called a thromboelastograph hemostasis analyzer accepts
a sample of blood, forms a clot with it, and measures the strength and elasticity of the clot.
The test determines if there is an excessive or reduced tendency to clot. Dogs with
reduced ability to clot on the TEG test have a much higher mortality rate. This test may
help determine the prognosis with DIC, at least in dogs.
Treatment
Ultimately what all this clotting and bleeding comes down to is loss of blood flow to the
tissues. Treatment centers on restoring normal circulation. This means intravenous fluid
administration is crucial to restore tissue perfusion. Often plasma transfusions are used to
replenish consumed blood clotting proteins. Plasma is incubated with an anticoagulant
substance called heparin before it is administered. Heparin activates anti-thrombin, which
as mentioned has been depleted in DIC.
The most significant factor in the treatment of DIC is removal of the original disease that
predisposed the patient to DIC in the first place. If this can be achieved, it would be the
best chance at resolving DIC.

Flea Anemia in Cats and Dogs
Wendy Brooks, DVM, DABVP
Revised: March 31, 2025
Published: July 30, 2001
It is important to get the message
out early: Fleas aren't just a
nuisance. They drink blood, and
blood loss can kill.
In almost every case, the owner
had no idea that flea infestation
could be lethal.
It is hard to imagine that something
as tiny as a flea could be
dangerous. It is common
knowledge fleas can make pets
itch. Many pet owners are familiar
with the spectacular skin
inflammation in a flea-bite-allergic
pet, but many people forget that
fleas drink blood and that lots of
fleas can drink a lot of blood. The
physical state of inadequate red
blood cells is called anemia, and when it is severe enough, it is a life-threatening
condition.
Pets will not itch from their fleas unless they are allergic to flea bites. No
scratching does not mean no fleas.
It is easy to underestimate a pet’s infestation. Only animals allergic to flea bites will itch
from their fleas. This means that the animal who is not allergic to flea bites will not be
scratching or losing hair. Thus, an owner may not realize that the pet has a heavy
infestation. If your pet is effective at licking and self-grooming, it may be hard to see the
fleas, especially if the owner does not have a flea comb. Do not rely on your own ability to
see the fleas; use reliable flea control regardless of what you see or do not see.
Check for Flea Dirt
The black, pepper-like specks found in an infested pet’s coat are actually bits of blood that
have been sucked up by the flea and excreted in neat little packages to feed the larval
fleas that hatch in the environment. Even if live fleas are not seen, flea dirt means that live
fleas are there.
Who Is Most Vulnerable?
It takes a lot of fleas to produce enough blood loss to create a life-threatening situation for
the host pet, but it still happens commonly. The following situations are high risk for flea
anemia:

Very young kittens being raised
outdoors or by a mother cat who
goes outdoors. Young kittens are
small and do not have blood to
spare. Furthermore, they are
growing and trying to expand their
blood volume; they are too young
to groom themselves effectively
and remove their own fleas. Flea
anemia is probably the number one
cause of death in open-household
kittens.
Elderly cats who go outdoors. The
elderly cat is often debilitated from other metabolic problems. Grooming is less
efficient, and an older cat is just not strong enough to withstand much blood
loss.
Outdoor puppies' situation is similar to that of kittens’: too small to effectively
groom and trying to grow in the face of ongoing blood loss.
Eventually, the weakness catches up with these animals, and they will die unless they
receive a blood transfusion.
Evaluation
The good news is that these patients can still be treated even fairly late in the course of
the disease. Often, they will need blood transfusions or transfusions with blood
substitutes. They will also need to have their fleas removed and will ultimately need to be
returned to an environment where they will be protected from further flea infestation.
The first step is recognizing the problem. This is not difficult for a trained veterinary
healthcare worker, but it may not be easy for an uninformed pet owner. The affected
animal will have pale gums (normal gums are shell-pink; anemic gums can be completely
white). In advanced diseases, the patient will be listless and even cold. A flea comb can
be used to check for flea dirt. Pets sometimes eat small pebbles, dirt, or cat litter when
they are anemic in an effort to obtain more iron.
Be familiar with the normal color of your pet’s gums so that you can recognize a
problem.
Regular flea combing can help nip a big problem in the bud.
Use flea control products all year round so you don't get caught with a surprise
heavy flea burden in the spring.
A test called a hematocrit (HCT) or packed cell volume (PCV) is easily done in your
veterinarian's office to find out the severity of your pet's anemia. The hematocrit or PCV
reflects the percentage of red blood cells that should be in a sample of blood.
Normal Hematocrit/ PCV Ranges:
Dogs: 37-55
Cats: 30-45
Treatment
Blood transfusions may be considered when values reach 20 or less, as recommended by
your veterinarian.

Ridding the critically ill patient of fleas can be problematic. Often, the patient is too sick to
tolerate the stress of a bath and is too young or too small for flea control products. In this
situation, veterinarians have to use their judgment on the safest route to remove the fleas.
Nitenpyram (brand names Capstar®, PetArmor FastCaps®, and Capguard®) is a simple
product that has greatly enhanced our ability to clear fleas from a patient quickly and
safely. Nitenpyram is available without a prescription as a fast-acting flea-killing tablet. It is
labeled for use in animals weighing 2 lbs. or more and begins killing fleas within 20
minutes of oral administration. While it does not provide long-acting flea protection, its
ability to rapidly remove a lethal flea burden has made it especially popular for use on
patients with dangerous flea infestations.
Returning Home
Of course, after all the blood transfusions, heat support, and flea removal, the pet will
ultimately go home, potentially to the same environment where the infestation occurred in
the first place. Usually, topical flea control products will provide adequate future protection,
and the use of a vitamin and iron supplement will help the patient rebuild red blood cell
reserves.
If the infestation is severe, consider treating the home environment separately before the
patient returns to it. Your veterinarian can help you select safe and effective home
treatments. The most important prevention is the owner's education.
There Is No Reason for a Pet to Carry a Flea Burden in This Day and Age
There are still common misconceptions among pet owners:
People commonly believe they have flea bite sensitivity, and if they do not
perceive flea biting, then there cannot be a significant flea burden.
Fleas actually only bite people when they are newly emerged from their
cocoons (all insects undergo a caterpillar/cocoon stage) and are hunting for
their permanent host.
Waiting for a person to perceive a flea bite requires the flea population to have
successfully established itself in the environment (e.g., the house) and
progressed to the production of new adult fleas. In reality, when fleas bite
people, a significant population is present for weeks or longer.
Many people believe that a pet with fleas will scratch or be itchy. In reality, only
the pets allergic to fleas will be itchy.
It is also commonly believed that fleas are simply part of pet ownership and that
there is no way to avoid them. This may have been true at one time, but, in
reality, fleas have been optional for decades, with flea control methods
achieving higher levels of convenience and safety each year. The days of
sprays, powders, and foggers are largely gone, supplanted by chewable tablets
and spot-on preparations. No pet needs to have fleas in the 21 century, and
new products are being released every year.
The general pet-owning population has certainly heard of fleas and is aware of most
of the modern flea control products. Yet, still, pets die from this easily preventable
problem because people do not realize how serious it can be and cannot recognize
when it has gotten to a serious point. Be proactive and keep up your flea control all
year round; if you wait for what you think of as warm weather, your pet may well
already be infested. Do not assume a pet with fleas will scratch. Do not assume that if
the humans are not being bitten, then the flea burden must be light. Do not be one of
those people whose beloved pet is lost to an easily preventable disease.

Multiple Myeloma in Dogs and Cats
Jacqueline Brister, DVM
Published: April 13, 2020
Multiple myeloma is a cancer of plasma cells, which develop from a type of white blood
cell called a B cell. Plasma cells produce antibodies, which are used by the body to fight
infections. In patients that develop multiple myeloma, these plasma cells multiply
uncontrollably.
Multiple myeloma is rare in cats and dogs. Scientists have not yet been able to discover
why this type of cancer occurs. Potential factors that lead to a pet developing multiple
myeloma are genetics or inheritance from a parent, certain viral infections, exposure to
carcinogens, and continual stimulation of the immune system (for example, having a
chronic illness).
When multiple myeloma occurs, the number of plasma cells increase unchecked. They
are created in the bone marrow, so typically over time, their overproduction crowds out
other cells made in the bone marrow such as other types of white blood cells, red blood
cells, and platelets. This form of multiple myeloma is the classic appearance in people and
dogs. Cats may also develop this form of the disease, but more often develop plasma cell
cancer in organs outside the bone marrow, such as the liver or spleen.
Secondary diseases, sometimes known as paraneoplastic syndromes, are common with
multiple myeloma. Many of these occur because of changes in the immune system
caused by plasma cell overproduction. Examples include renal/kidney disease, elevated
calcium levels, bone loss (also known as osteolysis), decreased immune function,
bleeding disorders, and increased blood thickness (known as hyperviscosity syndrome).
Symptoms include acting tired and/or weak, vomiting or throwing up, loose stools, and not
wanting to eat. Unfortunately, many other issues can cause these symptoms as well, so at
first it may be difficult to figure out what is wrong with your pet. Drinking and urinating a
lot, trouble walking, and signs of bleeding (e.g. nosebleeds, bleeding gums, pale skin,
bruising) may also be seen.
Because symptoms don’t point directly to the issue, different types of testing are needed
to diagnose multiple myeloma. A blood test to evaluate how the red blood cells, white
blood cells, and platelets are functioning, called a CBC or complete blood count, may be
performed. Another blood test called a serum biochemistry or biochemistry profile is also
commonly used. It gives the veterinarian information on how the internal organs are
functioning. In multiple myeloma and a few other diseases, the globulin level (a type of
protein) is usually increased. Serum biochemistry test will give information about the
globulin level as well. Additional lab tests may include some for bleeding irregularities,
urine testing, and a test to assess certain proteins in the blood, known as serum protein
electrophoresis. X-rays, ultrasound, and bone marrow aspiration or biopsy are frequently
done as well.
Treatments are available for multiple myeloma, but cure is rare. That being said,
treatments used will help the pet feel better, with improvement in symptoms noted within a
few weeks of starting therapy. Average survival times once a pet is diagnosed are 220-930

that do not receive any treatments do not live as long as most pets that are treated, but
how long they can live without treatment is not clear.

Red blood cells are basically little microscopic bags of hemoglobin. Before getting into
what hemoglobin is about, it is important to grasp the simplicity of the red blood cell. It has
no nucleus and thus no DNA. It has no internal structures and no ability to perform
complicated metabolism-related processes. Despite its simplicity, its function is crucial,
and this is where hemoglobin comes in. A red blood cell basically has one job: carrying
hemoglobin throughout the body. What is hemoglobin? It is the iron-containing complex
protein that allows for oxygen transport to the tissues (as well as carbon dioxide transport
to the lungs for removal). Inadequate red blood cell numbers mean inadequate
hemoglobin, which means inadequate oxygen delivery. In the whole patient, this translates
to lack of energy, poor appetite, and pallor (paleness) - basically an important reduction in
life quality.
There are two important ways in which the kidney patient loses red blood cells. The first
way is through bone marrow suppression. The second way is bleeding. We will review
both of these as well as hemodilution and what can be done about them. Maintaining a
stable red blood cell quantity keeps animals energetic and spirited and is crucial to staying
alive.
Bone Marrow Suppression
One of the functions of the kidney is the production of the
hormone called erythropoietin (pronounced “urithro-po-eetin”).
This hormone, often simply referred to as Epo, tells the bone
marrow to make more red blood cells. When the kidney is
damaged, its ability to produce erythropoietin is compromised.
Thus, there will be less erythropoietin and thus less red blood cell
production. Red cells are still produced, but over time, the red cell
count drops.
A simple measurement of a red blood cell count is called the
packed cell volume test or PCV. The packed cell volume value is
an expression of the percentage of the blood’s volume which is
taken up by red blood cells. It can be measured using only a drop
or two of blood and can be done while you wait in any veterinary
office. The sample is spun in a machine called a centrifuge to
separate the red cells, white cells, and serum. The blood tube is
then read against a chart to get the packed cell volume. Alternatively, hematocrit or HCT
can be evaluated by measuring the amount of hemoglobin in the sample using a blood
analyzer. Both measurements are common in most small animal hospitals, and testing
can be done while you wait.
Practically speaking, PCV and hematocrit measure the same thing.

In renal patients, weakness becomes
evident in dogs and cats when the
packed cell volume drops below 20.
   
What Can We Do?
Thanks to genetic engineering, human
erythropoietin is commercially available in an injectable form. This means that the
hormone that the kidney has failed to make is replaced with injections. Injections are given
three times a week at first but when the patient is more stable they can be backed off to
twice or even once a week.
Pros
The injections can easily be given at home.
Treatment with erythropoietin injections is generally extremely effective as
normal red blood cell counts are usually achieved within 4 weeks.
Cons
An iron supplement must be given simultaneously so that the bone marrow will
have the building blocks necessary to make red blood cells.
Packed cell volume (or hematocrit) should be monitored weekly until the patient
stabilizes, so at first, the patient will need frequent veterinary visits. If this
monitoring is skipped, it is easy for the red cell count to become too high,
thickening the blood and causing high blood pressure, which in turn creates
more kidney damage in addition to other problems.
Cost of treatment is reasonable for small pets such as cats and smaller dogs
but could be prohibitive for even a medium-sized dog.
Because the product used is a human-origin protein, it can induce a cat or dog
to generate antibodies against it. When the immune system is stimulated in this
way, it not only attacks the human erythropoietin but also the patient’s own
erythropoietin, making mild anemia more severe. If this happens, transfusions
may be needed to manage the anemia. When the Epo injections stop,
eventually, the antibody production stops, and the anemia resolves somewhat,
but Epo cannot be used in this patient again, and periodic transfusions then
become the only means of managing anemia.
How often does this happen? In a presentation by Dr. Sheri Ross at the 2006 meeting of
the American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine, she noted that in one study of dogs
and cats with naturally occurring kidney failure, two of three dogs treated with
erythropoietin for greater than 90 days and five of seven cats treated for greater than 180
days developed refractory anemia that was attributed to anti-erythropoietin antibodies. A
clinically significant immunologic reaction to erythropoietin has been reported to occur in

20-70 percent of treated veterinary patients. A more commonly published statistic is that
antibody production is a problem in 30-40 percent of pets using human erythropoietin but
this complication poses a sobering thought. It is important not to use this hormone at the
first sign of anemia but wait until it is really and truly needed.
Is Darbepoetin Better than Erythropoietin?
Darbepoetin is a synthetic hormone meant to improve on the natural hormone,
erythropoietin. The synthetic version lasts longer so is typically only used weekly. Less
frequent use makes the product less likely to create the antibody problem described
above. The cost of darbepoetin is substantially higher than for erythropoietin but ends up
being similar given that darbepoetin is used less frequently (i.e. the bottle costs much
more but it lasts much longer). It appears that the changes made in the amino acid
sequence have made darbepoetin less likely to generate anti-erythropoietin antibodies but
in a patient that is already having a problem with antibodies, darbepoetin is close enough
to Epo to be inactivated as well.
Why doesn't darbepoetin have the same problem with antibodies as
human erythropoietin? For one thing, darbepoetin is used much less frequently so
immunological exposure to the non-feline protein is reduced. For another, it appears
that the changes in the amino acid sequence have made darbepoetin less likely to
generate anti-erythropoietin antibodies. Still, in a patient that is already having issues with
antibodies, darbepoetin is likely to be close enough to be inactivated as well.
Read more information on erythropoietin.
Bleeding
The calcium-phosphorus imbalance that goes with renal disease is reviewed elsewhere in
this center but the bottom line is that the excess blood phosphorus that results in renal
insufficiency leads to the demineralization of bone and mineral deposits in soft tissues.
Mineralization is inflammatory and, when it occurs in the GI tract, it leads to bleeding,
ulceration, and pain. The renal patient cannot afford appetite loss, nausea, or further blood
loss, so treatment is needed while other efforts are being made to control phosphorus
levels.
Beyond the phosphorus level, another problem is a hormone called gastrin. Gastrin is a
hormone involved in food digestion and is a stimulus for the stomach to release acid.
Normally, when the need for gastrin has passed, the kidney removes it from the circulation
but in the kidney patient gastrin is not efficiently removed. The prolonged presence of
gastrin also prolongs the stomach’s secretion of acid, which can lead to ulceration.
How Do We Know there is Stomach or Intestinal Ulceration?
There are several clues in the lab work and in the patient’s physical appearance that tell
us that additional therapy is needed to control this kind of blood loss.
Horrendous inflammation in the mouth (odor, bloody or purulent drool, sticky
discharge on the lips and chin) includes ulceration. When ulceration in the
mouth is this bad, we can assume similar erosion is occurring deeper in the
tract.
A blood urea nitrogen (BUN) level that is more elevated than the creatinine is a
sign of GI bleeding. BUN partly depends on dietary protein. Bleeding into the GI
tract provides the intestine with blood to digest and the BUN rises further. Some
laboratories include a BUN: creatinine ratio to highlight this phenomenon (a
ratio greater than 20 suggests intestinal bleeding).
Uncontrolled phosphorus in and of itself suggests mineralization in the GI tract.

What Can We Do?
Medications for nausea and appetite stimulation can be used. The most important
treatment, of course, is going to be control of the phosphorus level. Other treatments
include the following:
Antibiotics
When the mouth is purulent, there is probably a secondary infection and antibiotics can
help clear it. Antiseptic mouthwashes may also be of benefit.
Antacids
Reducing stomach acid helps reduce pain and bleeding when the GI lining is ulcerated (at
least in the stomach). At present, there is no evidence that using antacids in IRIS stages 1-
3 is beneficial, but this becomes relevant in the more advanced stages.
Gastroprotection
Sucralfate is an oral medication that forms gentle webbing that is effectively a bandage
over the ulcers, protecting them from further irritation.
Hemodilution
Pets coming to the veterinarian in Stage IV or late Stage III kidney failure are often
dehydrated. A typical scenario is a pet that had been drinking lots of water and eating
fairly well who suddenly stops eating and is listless. Possibly, it is even noticeable that the
pet has lost weight (though this is often erroneously attributed to age). The owner waits a
day or two to see if the pet will start eating again and get better on his own, and when that
does not happen, he is brought to the veterinarian. Once the diagnosis of kidney failure is
made, fluid therapy will be recommended, possibly fairly aggressively to drive the toxin
levels down quickly. When blood tests are rechecked, anemia that was not originally
present may be apparent, or existing anemia may be worse.
This is not a big problem if the patient is not particularly anemic, to begin with, but if the
patient is already low on red blood cells or if fluid therapy is aggressive by the end of
hospitalization or even in the middle of it, the patient may be feeling the low red cell count.
Are the fluids making the patient anemic? No. The patient is just as anemic as he was
prior to fluid therapy, but without dehydration, the true red blood cell count is revealed.
Hemodilution does not create anemia so much as it unmasks anemia.
What Can Be Done?
What we do not want to do is withhold fluids from a dehydrated patient. The first step in
restoring or at least maximizing kidney function is to get the kidneys the blood supply they
need, which means no dehydration can be permitted. If the patient is significantly anemic,
either before or after rehydration, then they may need a blood transfusion to get their red
cell count back to a more livable level quickly. Restoration and maintenance of the red cell
count is part of the art of managing renal disease.

Thrombocytopenia in Dogs and Cats
Becky Lundgren, DVM
Revised: May 24, 2021
Published: March 22, 2004
Platelets (thrombocytes) are produced in the bone marrow. Platelets circulate in the blood.
When your pet gets cut, platelets stick to the edges of the cut and to one another, forming
a plug. They then release chemicals that react with fibrinogen and other plasma proteins,
leading to the formation of a blood clot.
If your pet has a condition called thrombocytopenia, his platelet count is low. When the
platelet count is low, it is harder for clotting to occur.
Signs of thrombocytopenia vary, but can include petechial (small, pinpoint) hemorrhages
in the skin or mucous membranes (lining of the mouth, for example), nosebleeds,
hematuria (blood in the urine), melena (blood in the feces), and bleeding into the joints or
body cavities. The lower the platelet count is, the more likely it is that your pet will show
signs. (Some animals may show no warning signs at all, and the thrombocytopenia may
be discovered only during routine health exams.)
Major causes of thrombocytopenia are immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (an
autoimmune disease), bone marrow cancers, infectious diseases, hereditary diseases,
drug/vaccination reactions, vasculitis (leading to deep vein thrombosis), and disseminated
intravascular coagulation.
Thrombocytopenia is not common in dogs and cats, although there are several breeds of
dogs that are predisposed to it. Animals with cancer are at higher risk than those without
cancer, but it can occur in a dog/cat of any age, breed, or sex.
Diagnostic tests include: blood tests (platelet count, complete blood count, serum
biochemistry), urinalysis, chest or abdominal radiographs (to look for diseases that could
be causing the thrombocytopenia), tests for specific infectious diseases (Rocky Mountain
spotted fever, ehrlichiosis, etc.), bone marrow aspiration, and tests for immune system
function.
Treatment is based on the cause of the thrombocytopenia, and may include antibiotics,
corticosteroids, blood transfusions, etc.
Prognosis depends on the cause of the thrombocytopenia. A mild, self-limiting vaccineinduced thrombocytopenia has an excellent prognosis, while a thrombocytopenia due to
cancer might have a much worse prognosis.

Von Willebrand's Disease in Dogs
Wendy Brooks, DVM, DABVP
Revised: July 15, 2023
Published: March 13, 2004
Most people are familiar with hemophilia A, an
inherited blood clotting defect in human beings
affecting only male children. Most people, however,
are not as familiar with von Willebrand's disease and
hear of it for the first time when they ask questions
about breeding their dog. Von Willebrand's disease,
like hemophilia A, is an inherited blood clotting defect
and breeds at high risk should be screened before
being allowed to breed.
Breeds routinely tested are Doberman Pinscher,
Golden Retriever, Shetland Sheepdog, Rottweiler,
Miniature Schnauzer, German Shepherd, German
Short-Haired Pointer, Standard Poodle, and Scottish
Terrier.
What is Von Willebrand's Factor?
Von Willebrand's factor is a protein complex produced
both by platelets (the blood cells involved in clotting)
and by the cells lining blood vessels. It is made up of
several smaller proteins bound together. Von
Willebrand's disease results when there is a defect in
any one of these proteins. When a blood vessel tears and bleeding occurs, platelets are
called to the area to clump upon each other, thus plugging up the hole and staunching the
bleeding. While the platelets are in place, a cascade of blood clotting factors activates,
ultimately leading to the production of fibrin (the material scars are made of) to more
permanently seal the vessel. Von Willebrand's factor acts as the glue holding the platelets
together and holding them onto the surface of the torn blood vessel. Von Willebrand's
factor also serves to stabilize clotting factor VIII, one of the proteins involved in forming
the fibrin clot.
See a short video depicting the normal blood clotting system.
When there is something wrong with a body's von Willebrand's factor, platelets do not
stick together properly and inappropriate, prolonged wound bleeding occurs. Bleeding
can be noted in association with minor injury or surgery but can also manifest as
spontaneous bleeding, especially recurring nose bleeds, bloody urine, and/or black tarry
diarrhea.
Types of Von Willebrand's Disease
There are three types of von Willebrand's disease.

8/2/25, 10:23 PM Von Willebrand's Disease in Dogs - Veterinary Partner - VIN
https://veterinarypartner.vin.com/default.aspx?pid=19239&catId=254087&id=4952042&ind=33&objTypeID=1007 1/4
Type I
In Type I von Willebrand's disease, all the proteins making up von Willebrand's factor are
present but only in very small amounts. This is the type common in the Doberman
Pinscher, the Shetland Sheepdog, the German Shepherd Dog, and the Standard Poodle.
Type II
In Type II, the larger proteins making up von Willebrand's factor are completely absent,
leaving only the smaller proteins to do the job. This creates more severe bleeding
episodes and represents the type of von Willebrand's disease usually seen in German
Short-Haired and German Wire-Haired Pointers.
Type III
In Type III, there is simply no von Willebrand's factor at all. This is the most severe form
and is usually seen in Scottish Terriers, Chesapeake Bay Retrievers, and Shetland
Sheepdogs. Von Willebrand's disease is not limited to the breeds listed here; forms of it
have been found in over 50 breeds, as well as in cats and humans. Unlike the genetics of
Hemophilia A in humans, which is reviewed in detail in virtually every high school biology
class as an example of a classic sex-linked recessive trait, von Willebrand's disease is not
as simple. Males and females are equally affected and the inheritance seems to be
recessive but complicated.
Testing for Von Willebrand's Factor
Knowing a dog's von Willebrand's status is important clinically when there is concern
about a patient's ability to clot, and it’s also important before breeding. With breeding, it is
important to identify genetic carriers of von Willebrand's. A carrier of von Willebrand's
should under no circumstances be bred to another carrier as this is likely to create
affected dogs, so members of the classically affected breeds should be screened. There is
great controversy as to whether carriers should even be bred at all, as this will potentially
create more carriers.
Classically, testing for this disease is accomplished by measuring von Willebrand's factor
in a blood sample. The amount of factor in the patient's serum is compared to that found
in "normal" dogs. The patient's results are compared to the normal and expressed in a
percentage, thus, it is possible for a patient to have greater than 100 percent.
Normal is considered to be 70-180 percent.
Borderline is considered to be 50-69 percent.
Abnormal (affected or genetic carrier) is considered to be less than 49% though these
results, in part, depend on the laboratory running the test. Dogs in the "abnormal" group
are at risk for bleeding and should definitely not be bred.
A dog may test differently on different days, when blood is drawn from different veins,
when the dog is more excited, or if the dog is pregnant, so it may be necessary to test a
dog several times before being comfortable with the result. This type of testing does not
indicate what type of von Willebrand's disease the dog has and further testing by a
technique called electrophoresis is needed to do this if you are interested. Knowing the
type of von Willebrand's disease is unlikely to change therapy, thus, further testing is not
commonly done.
DNA Testing
DNA testing is currently available for many von Willebrand's breeds. At present, there are
many DNA testing labs throughout the U.S. and Europe that can test for von Willebrand's
disease. Typically, the pet owner receives a test kit that can be used at home and
instructions on how to collect a cheek swab from the dog's mouth. Results should indicate
if the patient is clear, affected, or if the patient is a carrier.
Testing Clotting Ability Prior to Planned Surgery

A simple screening test often done before surgery is a buccal bleeding time. A small
wound is created in the mouth using a spring-loaded blade created just for this purpose (a
Symplate device or Surgicutt device). The time required for clotting to occur is measured
and should be under four minutes or so if platelet function is normal. The patient is
generally under anesthesia at this point.
The test has previously been accomplished by clipping a toenail short and inducing
bleeding, but this technique has largely been abandoned as there are too many toenail
variables to create a standardized test. That said, there are some issues with buccal
bleeding time as well. Even though the spring load is standardized, as is the length and
sharpness of the instrument, there is still some subjectivity in positioning the device, as
well as some patient variables (red blood cell concentration, blood viscosity, etc.) that can
influence results.
In a perfect world, a platelet function analyzer is used to measure what is called a
collagen/ADP closure time. This is the most accurate measurement of how well platelets
adhere and form clots, but this technology is not readily available to most small animal
hospitals at this time.
Suddenly Symptoms?
You would expect a congenital disease like von Willebrand's disease to manifest in
puppyhood, and in fact, this is usually so. Von Willebrand's disease is usually detected
when there is unexpected hemorrhage during a spay or neuter or when screening tests
are done in anticipation of surgery on a member of a von Willebrand's breed.
It is possible for borderline dogs to show signs of bleeding later on. For example, a dog
with borderline von Willebrand's factor might become hypothyroid later in life, and this
hormonal change could be just enough to make the bleeding disorder clinically evident.
This is not a common scenario with hypothyroidism, but it has been reported.
Treatment of the Affected Dog
When hemorrhage is occurring or is anticipated, as with a planned surgical procedure, the
best treatment is the administration of von Willebrand's factor by transfusion. Pure von
Willebrand's factor cannot be purchased from a blood bank but a blood product called
cryoprecipitate, which is particularly rich in von Willebrand's factor, can be. Complete
plasma is the next best choice and is much more available than cryoprecipitate.
Administration of cryoprecipitate improves bleeding time for approximately 4 hours after
administration.
A hormone called DDAVP (or desmopressin acetate) can be helpful as its use seems to
cause a sudden release of von Willebrand's factor into the bloodstream. After a 30-minute
activation period, the use of DDAVP shortens the bleeding time for approximately 2 hours
after the DDAVP injection. This is very helpful in preparing for surgery but not something
useful on a day-to-day basis.
There are two considerations with von Willebrand’s disease: screening breeding animals
so that this genetic disorder is not passed on and identifying and treating affected animals.
If you have one of the at-risk breeds, consider having a screening test, especially if you
are considering a major surgery. If you plan to breed your pet, von Willebrand’s testing is a
good idea regardless of the breed, but it is a special concern for at-risk breeds. If you
have questions, your veterinarian’s office will be happy to answer them.
