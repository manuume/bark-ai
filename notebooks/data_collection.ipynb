The protocols for sample collection and submission are therefore also subject to change.  The practitioner and diagnostic laboratory staff must maintain good communication to complete their diagnostic efforts efficiently and provide optimal service to the client. Practitioners must be specific and clear in their test requests. The laboratory staff will provide guidance regarding sample collection and handling protocols, as well as assistance in the interpretation of test results.  Most diagnostic laboratories publish user guidelines with preferred protocols for sample collection and submission; however, the following broad recommendations are fairly standard.  A detailed case history should be included with submitted samples. This information is particularly critical for the interpretation of samples submitted for cytologic and histologic evaluation. The submission form should be protected in a waterproof bag to avoid damage from any fluids in the packaged materials.  A detailed case history should include the following elements:  owner's first and last name  species  breed or size/weight (if breed unknown)  sex  age  animal identification  relevant clinical signs  gross appearance (including size and anatomic location) of lesions  previous treatment, including response to treatment (if any)  results of relevant diagnostic testing, such as CBC, serum biochemical analysis, cytologic and histologic evaluation, and imaging studies  for population health studies, morbidity and mortality in the group  If a zoonotic disease is suspected, this should also be clearly indicated on the submission form to alert laboratory personnel.  Packaging of Samples from Animals for Shipment The shipment of biological specimens should comply with protocols established by the courier or shipping service used. In some instances, air transport requires compliance with International Aviation and Transportation Association (IATA) regulations for hazardous materials.  These regulations include restrictions on the volume of formalin that can be shipped in a container: no more than 30 mL of free liquid solution in each inner container, and no more than 1 L in the entire outer package. Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Shipments with fresh tissue samples are required to be clearly labeled:  UN2814, Infectious substances, affecting humans  UN2900, Infectious substances, affecting animals  UN3373, Biological substances, Category B  Most veterinary diagnostic samples are classified as Category B (an infectious substance not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs). If high-risk or reportable diseases are suspected, it is essential to contact state and federal veterinary agencies regarding necessary shipment precautions.  Further details can be found at the International Air Transport Association website and the US Postal Service Postal Explorer website as well as commercial courier websites.  A fundamental approach to packaging samples involves a 3-layer barrier to protect them:  The sample is placed in an appropriate primary container (sealed jar, bag, or tube).  The primary container is then enclosed within a secondary container, which also includes absorbent material.  The secondary container is then placed in the shipping box (tertiary container), which often houses refrigerant or cold packs as well as various cushioning materials (eg, polystyrene foam) to protect the sample. Ideally, the tertiary container is a sturdy polystyrene refrigerator box or a cardboard box lined with a fitted polystyrene lining.  Items such as syringes, obstetrical gloves, and containers without sealable orifices are not suitable for shipment. Under no circumstances should needles, scalpel blades, or any other potentially injurious item (eg, broken microscope slides with sharp edges) be submitted to the lab.  Liquid samples should not ship in plastic bags; instead, a sealable jar should be used. Waterproof markers should be used when labeling specimen bags and containers; at a minimum, patient identification and specimen type (eg, urine, serum, plasma) are critical labeling information.  Coolant materials should be sealed in separate plastic bags to prevent condensation damage. Refrigerant or cold packs should not be placed in direct contact with samples, such as tubes of whole blood, that could suffer adverse effects if frozen in transit.  The suitably protected, completed submission form must be included.  If dry ice is used, this should be noted on the cardboard box label, and the lid should not be sealed with tape. Otherwise, CO2 released from the dry ice could increase pressure and damage the package or contents.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Histologic Evaluation Tissues for microscopic examination collected either via biopsy or during necropsy can be critical to obtaining a diagnosis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and other advanced tests that can be applied to formalin-fixed tissue further reinforce the utility of histologic evaluation as diagnostic technique.  Autolyzed tissues are generally useless for histologic evaluation; prompt necropsy and organ sampling are critical.  Tissue should not be frozen prior to fixation.  Other than CNS tissues, samples collected for histologic evaluation should never be > 1 cm thick (preferably 5–7 mm) and must be immediately placed in ≥ 10 times their volume of phosphate-buffered 10% formalin to ensure adequate fixation.  Tissues should be representative of any lesions present and, in the case of cutaneous punch biopsies and biopsies obtained via endoscopic collection, be centered directly on the grossly visible lesions.  Wedge biopsies or tissue samples collected at necropsy should include some of the apparently normal surrounding tissue; the interface between normal and abnormal tissue may provide key information.  Excisional biopsies of small tumors (< 1.5 cm) may be cut in half. Larger tumors may be sliced like bread so that formalin can penetrate to the face of each slice. Alternatively, several representative samples (7 mm wide, including the interface of normal and abnormal) may be collected.  Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Submission of tissue that has been stored in formalin is acceptable within any time frame, although quality of sample will degrade over time. Prolonged formalin fixation can adversely affect advanced testing; for example, immunohistochemical testing is not recommended for tissue that has been stored in formalin for > 7 weeks because results may be invalid.  Samples should be shipped in laboratory-approved unbreakable containers with screw-top lids and packed in a manner that prevents spillage or freezing during shipment (see Packaging of Samples for Shipment).  Specific tissues collected at necropsy require additional attention:  Because the GI mucosa decomposes rapidly, short sections of gut collected at necropsy should be opened lengthwise to allow adequate fixation.  If the spinal cord is submitted, the dura mater should be carefully incised lengthwise to permit more rapid penetration to the cord.  Fixing the brain poses a special dilemma, especially if a neuroanatomical location of the lesions within the organ could not be determined antemortem.  Ideally, a whole, intact, fixed brain is required for complete histologic evaluation.  Immersion of the brain for many days in a large volume of formalin is required for adequate fixation; consequently, brains are commonly transported in an only partially fixed state. If the specimen can be shipped by overnight delivery, it may be acceptable to send a chilled, carefully packaged, unfixed brain, which can then be processed at the diagnostic laboratory.  Often, the brain is halved longitudinally and one half is sent unfixed (fresh), properly refrigerated, for microbiological testing, while the other half partially fixes in transit. This method can prove unsatisfactory if a solitary unilateral lesion is involved. Slicing the brain into widths suitable for rapid fixation introduces considerable fixation artifact and should be avoided if possible; fixing the intact (or halved) brain in a large volume of formalin for > 24 hours is preferred.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Microbiological Testing Any specific infectious agents that are suspected clinically should be noted on the submission form; some organisms have specific growth requirements (eg, anaerobic culture, special media) that may not be routinely used in laboratories unless the pathogen was cited as a differential diagnosis.  Laboratory techniques and capabilities for microbiological testing vary; however, most tests rely on either the growth or visualization of intact viable organisms or the detection of the nucleic acids and proteins of these pathogens. Therefore, unfixed specimens (tissue, fluid, etc) should be collected aseptically and shipped promptly to avoid degradation.  If microbial culture of a fluid specimen such as urine or a cavitary effusion is a possibility, a separate aliquot of the fluid in a sterile, additive-free container should be submitted. Tubes containing EDTA or other preservatives are generally ideal for cytologic evaluation but unacceptable for culturing.  If PCR assays are to be performed, it is particularly important to avoid cross contamination between multiple animals in a submission; this principle applies to tissues, fluids, and even dissection instruments.  Furthermore, swabs for PCR analysis should not be placed in agar or charcoal-based transport media, and calcium alginate swabs should be avoided. Instead, sterile cotton- or polyester-tipped applicators should be shipped in a tube, either dry (without transport media) or with a few drops of sterile saline solution or viral transport media, depending on the individual laboratory's requirements.  Requirements for PCR assay can vary widely by specific PCR test, and consulting the recipient laboratory before obtaining the sample is strongly encouraged.  Some test protocols may permit pooling of organ specimens from an individual; however, it is generally preferable that each tissue be collected into separate, clearly labeled sterile bags or tubes for shipping. Gut samples must never be pooled in a container with other tissue samples.  Tissues and fluids for most microbiological assays may be frozen before shipment, but freezing is generally undesirable if samples can be chilled and delivered directly to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection.  Exceptions to this rule include analysis for certain toxins, such as those of Clostridium perfringens and C botulinum, in which degradation of the toxin must be prevented by prompt freezing after collection. Adequate coolant should be provided so that samples remain chilled (or frozen) until they reach the laboratory.  Fecal samples for parasitological testing should be submitted chilled in appropriately sealed containers. Freezing may have little impact on routine flotation or sedimentation tests but will negate the possibility of Baermann analysis for nematode larvae. Ectoparasites or nematodes being submitted for identification should be submitted in vials containing 70% alcohol.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Toxicological Testing If a known toxin is suspected, a specific analysis should always be requested—laboratories cannot just “check for poisoning.” A complete description of clinical and epidemiological findings may help differentiate poisoning from infectious diseases that mimic poisoning.  Pearls & Pitfalls  If a known toxin is suspected, a specific analysis should always be requested—laboratories cannot just “check for poisoning.”  The most critical samples to be collected are generally the following:  gastric contents  liver  kidney  whole blood  plasma or serum  urine  There are also some exceptions, such as the collection of cerebral tissue for cholinesterase analysis.  For some investigations, the diagnosis requires analysis of feed or water. If there is doubt regarding sample submission procedures, the laboratory should be contacted.  Freezing is critical to prevent the degradation of a few analytes, such as cholinesterase, zinc phosphide, and sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080). However, for most analytes, overnight shipping of chilled specimens will suffice.  The containers for packing and transporting specimens should be free of chemicals. Plastic containers (eg, jars) are ideal, and jars with metal tops should be avoided. Samples should be packed individually and all containers labeled.  If legal action is a possibility, all containers for shipment should be either sealed so that tampering can be detected or hand-carried to the laboratory and a receipt obtained. The chain of custody must be accurately documented.  If feed or water is suspected as the source of poisoning, chilled samples of these along with any descriptive feed tag should accompany the tissue samples. If at all possible, a representative composite sample of the feed should be submitted from the suspect lot or shipment (ie, aliquots from the top, middle, and bottom of the feed container).  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Hematological Testing Routine hematological tests require anticoagulated whole blood filled to the appropriate fill volume for the specimen collection tube. Overfilling or underfilling of tubes can cause unreliable analytic results due to an incorrect blood-additive ratio.  Ideally, several blood smears should be included. Blood smears should be prepared immediately after the sample has been collected in order to minimize artifacts, including altered erythrocyte morphology, platelet clumping, and general cell deterioration.  Anticoagulated blood should be kept refrigerated; blood smears should be stored at room temperature. EDTA is the anticoagulant of choice for mammalian CBCs.  EDTA is acceptable for most, but not all, nonmammalian species. Blood from stingrays, some bony fish, and some reptilian and avian species undergoes hemolysis when collected into EDTA, so heparin is commonly used for these species.  Blood for coagulation testing should be collected into a citrate (blue-top) tube containing trisodium citrate (3.2% or 3.8%, as specified by the reference laboratory). It is imperative that the tube be filled to the appropriate fill volume because underfilling can cause falsely prolonged clotting times.  For plasma-based assays, citrated plasma typically must be separated from whole blood within 6 hours after collection for measurement of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Plasma is separated by centrifugation at 1,500g for 15 minutes, after which the plasma is transferred to an additive-free plastic secondary tube using a disposable plastic pipette.  Plasma should ideally be analyzed within 1 hour after separation. However, many samples for coagulation testing are sent to reference laboratories for analysis, and adherence to laboratory-specific guidelines pertaining to specimen storage is advised.  Freezing of whole blood causes cell lysis and gross hemolysis, which interfere with testing; freezing of whole blood (during storage or specimen transport) must be avoided.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Serum Biochemical Analysis Anticoagulants present in plasma may result in spuriously increased or decreased test analyte values (eg, samples contaminated with potassium-EDTA have artifactually elevated potassium concentrations and decreased calcium concentrations); therefore, by default, serum should be submitted.  However, in some instances, heparinized plasma may be acceptable or, possibly, required. Consultation with the lab before collecting the specimen is recommended for any nonroutine tests or species.  Because lipemia can interfere with a number of chemistry tests for dogs and cats, food withholding is advisable for 12 hours before samples are collected unless there is a potential medical contraindication, such as with pediatric patients or toy dog breeds.  For serum samples, the blood should be drawn into a serum (red-top) tube or serum separator (tiger-top) tube. The sample should be held at room temperature for 20–30 minutes to allow complete clot formation and retraction. Incomplete clot formation may cause the serum to gel due to latent fibrin formation.  The clot should be separated from the glass by gently rimming the tube walls with an applicator stick to loosen the clot. The sample should then be centrifuged at moderate speed (~450 rpm) for 10 minutes.  If the sample has been collected into a serum separator tube, centrifugation will cause a layer of polymer gel to lodge between the packed cells and the serum. The gel layer should be inspected to ensure the integrity of the barrier, and repeated centrifugation is recommended if there is a visible crack in this layer.  If a serum (red-top) tube has been used, the serum should be removed and transferred to a clean tube to minimize artifacts (eg, glycolysis in the cellular component of the blood sample may result in an artifactually decreased glucose concentration). Serum should be refrigerated or frozen until analyzed. Delays in analysis may adversely affect the results for a number of analytes.  Rough handling of the sample or incomplete separation of erythrocytes from serum may promote hemolysis, which can interfere with certain tests. For chemistry panels, 0.5 mL of serum is typically preferred, although minimum laboratory requirements may vary and should be consulted for serum volumes < 0.5 mL.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Urinalysis Urine samples should be clearly labeled with specimen type because urine and serum may be grossly indistinguishable.  Noting the method through which the urine was obtained (free catch, catheterization, cystocentesis, etc) can be helpful for interpretation of findings; for example, free catch samples may have bacterial contaminants from the external genitalia and perineum, and catheterized samples often have greater numbers of transitional epithelial or urothelial cells due to mechanical exfoliation from passing of the catheter.  Clear specimen containers can facilitate gross examination of the urine. However, if urine is not evaluated within 30 minutes after collection, care must be taken to protect it from exposure to ultraviolet light, which causes degradation of urine constituents, including bilirubin.  Lids must be securely screwed on to prevent leakage, evaporation, or volatilization of ketones (if present). Containers must not be reused because traces of detergent can interfere with chemical analysis and bacterial contaminants can proliferate during specimen storage and transit.   Urine should be stored and shipped chilled, although it should be noted that crystal precipitation can occur. Urine is a caustic environment that causes rapid degradation of formed elements, including cells.  If urinary tract disease reflected by the sediment examination (eg, inflammation, infection, proliferative process involving neoplasia) is suspected, cytologic smears prepared from fresh urine sediment should be submitted along with the urine sample. Cytologic smears are air-dried and are prepared as described in the Samples for Cytologic Evaluation section.  As with other fluid samples, volume requirements apply to samples for urinalysis. The preferred volume is generally 5–6 mL, although lesser volumes may be accepted, depending on the lab.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Serologic Testing Serologic testing generally requires serum, but plasma is often satisfactory. Samples should be collected as described for serum biochemical analysis and should always be free of hemolysis.  In some instances, paired samples may be required for an adequate diagnosis. The acute sample should be collected early in the course of the disease and frozen. The convalescent sample should be collected 10–14 days later, and both samples should be forwarded to the laboratory at the same time.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Cytologic Evaluation For superficial mass effects, sampling by fine needle (ie, aspiration or coring/\"woodpecker\" technique) is typically of higher diagnostic yield and more representative of the primary lesion than samples obtained via surface impression. Impression smears are prone to contamination with debris and flora of the skin or environment, or may represent only secondary inflammation or infection.   Aspirated material must be spread into a monolayer (ie, approximately half the cells touch but do not overlap) after application to the slide (see lymphocyte and mesenchymal cell slides).  Monolayer of cytologic smear, lymphocytes   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Monolayer of cytologic smear, mesenchymal cells   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  The preferred spreading method involves gentle horizontal smearing using a second slide that is placed on top of the material after it is deposited on the bottom slide (see optimal preparation slide). This technique is superior to the vertical pull-apart technique (see pull-apart preparation slide).   Cytology smear with optimal preparation technique   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Pull-apart slide preparation   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive specimen density and cytolysis inhibit the ability to adequately evaluate cells in cytologic specimens (see Excessive specimen density, low magnification and high magnification slides; see also Excessive cytolysis (cell lysis) slide). Only intact cells can be evaluated cytologically because cytolysis introduces artifacts that can mimic malignancy, such as enlargement of nuclei and increased prominence of nucleoli.  Excessive specimen density, low magnification   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive specimen density, high magnification   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive cytolysis (cell lysis)   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Both the pull-apart technique and the lack of any effort to spread the material (ie, simple air drying of droplet-form deposited biological material) are prone to excessive specimen density and cytolysis, and may be nondiagnostic (see dense specimen without spreading slide).  Specimen deposited on slide without spreading   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Samples with a fluidic component can be spread in the same manner as blood smears. Highly cellular fluids may be smeared directly; fluids of low cellularity should be centrifuged to concentrate the cells.  Slides should be stored at room temperature and protected from dust as well as excessive humidity and prolonged exposure to light. It is important to physically label slides with patient identification as well as the source of the cytologic sample; labeling only slide boxes or cartons is unreliable because slides may be separated from the containers or containers reused.  Samples containing excessive ultrasound or lubricant gel may be nondiagnostic because this material is microscopically opaque and obscures cells as well as causing poor cellular stain uptake.  Other practical considerations for preparation of cytologic samples include always using fresh slides, avoidance of coverslips and acetate tape, and ensuring that cellular material is deposited towards the center of a single side of the slide (see specimen on both sides slide).  As digital scanning of slides becomes more prevalent in diagnostic labs, it is not possible for a pathologist to simply flip over the slide on their microscope to focus on the material on the opposite slide. In addition, if the material on the two sides overlaps, it is possible that the net effect will be material that is too thick to adequately assess.  Specimen present on both sides of the slide   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Exposure of blood and cytologic smears to formalin or formalin fumes (including proximity to sealed jars of formalin) will interfere with adequate staining and evaluation, potentially resulting in a nondiagnostic specimen. These slide preparations must never be submitted to the laboratory in the same package as formalin-fixed tissues.  Air-dried, unfixed smears are usually appropriate for immunocytochemical (ICC) staining; however, in some instances, shipping samples in tubes containing transport media is recommended. If special stains including ICC are anticipated, the laboratory should be contacted prior to submission to ensure their laboratory-specific protocol is followed.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Fluid Analysis Analysis of cavitary (peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial) effusions and other fluids (eg, synovial fluid, CSF) includes determination of protein content, total erythrocyte and WBC counts, and cytologic evaluation. Other tests may be performed depending on the source or appearance (eg, chylous fluid) of the effusion.  A sample of fluid should be collected into an EDTA (purple-top) tube for routine analysis. A second sample should be collected into a serum (red-top) tube if microbial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing or biochemical analyses are anticipated. These samples should be shipped chilled but not frozen.  Cytologic evaluation without measurement of other parameters (eg, total protein concentration, cell counts) is usually acceptable for mass effects characterized by a fluidic component.  Smears for cytologic evaluation should be prepared from a drop of the fluid immediately after the sample has been collected to minimize cell deterioration and other in vitro artifacts. Cytologic slides should be labeled with patient ID, source, and type of preparation (eg, direct, concentrated/sediment) and fluid and then submitted to the lab.  Samples of CSF should be collected into small EDTA tubes and shipped immediately with high priority; the cytologic value of CSF samples degrades rapidly, and the low cellularity makes examination of direct smears unrewarding. If sufficient CSF is available, then a serum (red-top) tube sample may be useful for serologic evaluation or culture attempts.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry can be performed on samples with an inherently fluidic composition (whole blood, cavitary effusions) and on organ (eg, lymph node, bone marrow) aspirates collected into fluid medium. Intact, well-preserved cells are necessary for accurate results. Consequently, samples 48 hours old or less are usually needed to ensure cell viability.  Specimen volumes can vary, depending on type of sample (eg, whole blood versus organ aspirate), and the lab should be consulted before collection of the specimen.  The lab may have additional recommendations pertaining to sample collection and submission. For example, depending on specimen transit times, it may be advisable to submit samples early in the week to avoid delays spanning the weekend.  Preparation of Samples for Genetic Analysis in Animals Tests based on the detection of specific genetic features range from karyotype analysis to the identification of specific genes.  The laboratory offering the test should be contacted to determine the specifics of sample collection and handling; required samples range from hair to skin or blood. Many blood-based analyses require collection into acid-citrate-dextrose (yellow-top) tubes and overnight shipment of chilled tubes to the laboratory.  Tissue samples for genetic analysis should be unfixed and shipped immediately after collection. As with most molecular techniques, aseptic collection and the prevention of cross contamination between samples is critical for reliable test results.  Key Points Overview of Diagnostic Procedures for the Private Practice Laboratory ByTrevor J. Whitbread, BVSc, DECVP, Abbey Veterinary Services/NationWide Laboraties; Karen W. Post, DVM, MS, DACVM, North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, Consumer Services, Rollins Animal Disease, Diagnostic Laboratory;Charles M. Hendrix, DVM, PhD, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University Reviewed/Revised Jun 2015 | Modified Sept 2024 Numerous laboratory tests can be done in a private practice laboratory. Use of a commercial laboratory versus in-house testing should be evaluated to determine whether in-house testing is practical and economical. Because the availability of diagnostic laboratories and their reporting intervals may be problematic (eg, nights and holidays), performing some diagnostic screening tests in-house is often desirable. However, because the people performing these tests often have minimal technical training, quality control procedures must be rigorous. The time and care that must be devoted to quality control issues may preclude in-house testing in many practices. Errors may occur not only in testing procedures but also in sample collection and handling and in recording results.  Tests can be done using either manual or automated methods. Manual methods tend to be time consuming and are more subject to human error. Automated and semiautomated systems are available but are more expensive. Factors to be considered include instrument and reagent costs (including materials for calibration and quality control), availability of personnel training, technical support, and instrument maintenance and service. Although service contracts can cost up to 10% of the purchase price of an instrument, they are often cost-effective because of the expense of instrument repair Clinical Biochemistry ByTrevor J. Whitbread, BVSc, DECVP, Abbey Veterinary Services/NationWide Laboraties; Karen W. Post, DVM, MS, DACVM, North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, Consumer Services, Rollins Animal Disease, Diagnostic Laboratory;Charles M. Hendrix, DVM, PhD, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University Reviewed/Revised Jun 2015 | Modified Sept 2024 Basic Test Panel: | Additional Tests: | Tests for Pancreatic Disease: | Handling of Samples: | Point-of-Care Tests: | The Practice Laboratory: Clinical biochemistry refers to the analysis of the blood plasma (or serum) for a wide variety of substances—substrates, enzymes, hormones, etc—and their use in diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Analysis of other body fluids (eg, urine, ascitic fluids, CSF) is also included. One test is very seldom specific to one clinical condition, and basic checklists of factors affecting the most commonly requested analytes are given below. Thus, rather than six tests that merely confirm or deny six possibilities, a well-chosen group of six tests can provide information pointing to a wide variety of different conditions by a process of pattern recognition. Biochemistry tests should be accompanied by full hematology, because evaluation of both together is essential for optimal recognition of many of the most characteristic disease patterns ( see Clinical Hematology).  Before samples are collected, a list of differential diagnoses should already be established based on the history and clinical examination. Then, additional appropriate tests can be added to the basic panel below.  Making a diagnosis entails establishing a list of differential diagnoses based on the history and clinical examination. Based on this list, tests can be selected to include or exclude as many of the differentials as possible. Yet more tests may be necessary until only one of the original list remains to determine the diagnosis. If all differentials are excluded, then the list must be reevaluated. It is not good practice to order tests without a sensible differential list unless the animal presents without definitive clinical signs.  Basic Test Panel: Most veterinary laboratories offer a basic panel of tests, which represents a minimal investigation applicable to most general situations. For small animals, a typical panel includes total protein, albumin, globulin (calculated as the difference between the first two analytes), urea, creatinine, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In addition, a yellow color seen in the plasma should be considered an indication to measure bilirubin. This panel may be modified as appropriate for other species, eg, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are more appropriate “liver enzymes” for horses and farm animals, or it may be more appropriate to concentrate primarily on muscle enzymes (CK and AST) in athletic animals.  Total protein level increases due to dehydration, chronic inflammation, and paraproteinemia. It decreases due to overhydration, severe congestive heart failure (with edema), protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, hemorrhage, burns, dietary protein deficiency, malabsorption, and some viral conditions (especially in horses).  Albumin level increases due to dehydration. It decreases due to the same factors as total protein, plus liver failure.  Urea level increases due to excess dietary protein, poor quality dietary protein, carbohydrate deficiency, catabolic states, dehydration, congestive heart failure, renal failure, blocked urethra, and ruptured bladder. It decreases due to low dietary protein, gross sepsis, anabolic hormonal effects, liver failure, portosystemic shunts (congenital or acquired), and inborn errors of urea cycle metabolism. Urea measurement is used especially to indicate renal disease and to a lesser extent liver dysfunction.  Creatinine level increases due to renal dysfunction, blocked urethra, and ruptured bladder. It decreases due to sample deterioration. Animals with a high muscle mass have high-normal creatinine concentrations, whereas animals with a low muscle mass have low-normal creatinine concentrations. Creatinine measurement is used especially for renal disease.  ALT is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of liver cells and, therefore, increases due to hepatocellular damage. It has a half life of 2–4 hr and rises higher than AST but recovers quicker. There are minor increases with muscle damage and hyperthyroidism.  ALP level increases due to increased bone deposition, liver damage, hyperthyroidism, biliary tract disease, intestinal damage, hyperadrenocorticism, corticosteroid administration, barbiturate administration, and generalized tissue damage (including neoplasia). The most common causes for an increase is raised levels of circulating steroids and biliary disease. The half-life is 72 hr in dogs but only 6 hr in cats. Levels in the cat are generally much lower than in the dog, and any increase in cats is considered significant. In dogs, ALP levels in the thousands of units are usually associated with increased steroid levels. ALP and ALT levels rarely rise above 1,000 units, even in severe liver disease.  GDH level increases in hepatocellular damage, particularly hepatic necrosis, in horses and ruminants.  GGT increases in longer-term liver damage; it is particularly useful in horses and ruminants.  CK, the classic “muscle enzyme,” increases markedly in rhabdomyolysis and aortic thromboembolism. Slight level increases are reported in hypothyroidism. Only a very small amount of muscle damage such as bruising or IM injections can result in high serum CK levels. In dogs and cats, unless investigating specific muscle disease, increased levels are generally of no clinical significance.  AST level increases in both muscle and liver damage but is of less value than ALT. The half-life is 5 hr in dogs and 77 min in cats. It is also reported to increase in hypothyroidism.  Most of the above parameters are associated with liver function/dysfunction and are frequently overinterpreted. In small animals, increases in ALT and ALP levels can reach four times normal and still be associated only with fatty change, a nonspecific finding and not, in most cases, a primary liver problem. Some laboratories also frequently receive liver biopsies from dogs that have significant increases in liver enzymes and bile acids >80 but that have normal histologic morphology. The reason for this is unknown.  In general, plasma enzyme levels decrease due to sample deterioration. Uncommonly, atrophy or fibrosis of an organ may result in unusually low plasma activities of the relevant enzymes.  Additional Tests: Further tests may be added to the basic panel, according to the principal presenting signs, to create panels for polydipsic animals, collapsing animals, etc. These panels are structured so that the patterns of abnormalities typical of all the likely differential diagnoses applicable to the situation can be discerned. For example, a polydipsia panel may add calcium, glucose, and cholesterol. Calcium allows recognition of hyperparathyroidism and other causes of hypercalcemia (which causes polydipsia and renal insufficiency), glucose may indicate diabetes mellitus and contributes to the pattern characteristic of hyperadrenocorticism, and cholesterol also adds to the appreciation of the “Cushing pattern.” Renal failure is covered by the tests already included in the basic panel. In contrast, in a panel for a \"collapsing animal,” calcium and glucose may be added to screen for hypocalcemia or hypoglycemia. Sodium and potassium are included to screen for hypoadrenocorticism or hypokalemia. Analytes that might be considered for incorporation in such expanded profiles are described below.  Sodium level increases due to Conn syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), restricted water intake, vomiting, and most causes of dehydration. It decreases due to hypoadrenocorticism, loss of any high-sodium fluid such as some forms of renal disease, and insufficient sodium provision during IV fluid therapy.  Potassium level increases due to hypoadrenocorticism and severe renal failure (especially terminal cases). It decreases due to Conn syndrome, chronic renal dysfunction, vomiting, diarrhea, and insufficient potassium provision during IV fluid therapy. Congenital hypokalemia occurs in Burmese cats.  Chloride level increases in acidosis, and in parallel with increases in sodium concentration. It decreases in alkalosis, vomiting (especially after eating), and in association with hyponatremia.  Total CO2 (bicarbonate) level increases in metabolic alkalosis and decreases in metabolic acidosis. It is less useful to assess respiratory acid/base disturbances.  Calcium level increases due to dehydration (which is also associated with increased albumin), primary hyperparathyroidism (neoplasia of parathyroid gland), primary pseudohyperparathyroidism (neoplasms producing parathormone-related peptide [PRP], usually perianal adenocarcinoma or some form of lymphosarcoma), bone invasion of malignant neoplasms, thyrotoxicosis (uncommon), and overtreatment of parturient paresis. It decreases due to hypoalbuminemia, parturient paresis, oxalate poisoning, chronic renal failure (secondary renal hyperparathyroidism), acute pancreatitis (occasionally), surgical interference with parathyroid glands, and idiopathic (autoimmune) hypoparathyroidism.  Phosphate level increases due to renal failure (secondary renal hyperparathyroidism). Decreases are seen in some downer cows and as part of the stress pattern in horses and small animals.  Magnesium level increases are rarely seen, including during acute renal failure. It decreases in ruminants due to dietary deficiency, either acute (grass staggers) or chronic, and diarrhea (uncommon).  Glucose level increases due to high-carbohydrate meals, sprint exercise, stress or excitement (including handling and sampling stress), glucocorticoid therapy, hyperadrenocorticism, overinfusion with glucose/dextrose-containing IV fluids, and diabetes mellitus. It decreases due to insulin overdose, insulinoma, islet cell hyperplasia (uncommon), acetonemia/pregnancy toxemia, acute febrile illness, and idiopathically (in certain dog breeds).  β-Hydroxybutyrate level increases in diabetes mellitus. It is a major component of ketoacidosis and as such is also increased in acetonemia/pregnancy toxemia and extreme starvation. It can be measured in both blood and urine.  Bilirubin level increases due to fasting (benign effect in horses and squirrel monkeys, may be caused by hepatic lipidosis in cats), hemolytic disease (usually mild increase), liver dysfunction, and biliary obstruction (intra- or extrahepatic). Theoretically, hemolysis is characterized by an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, whereas hepatic and post-hepatic disorders are characterized by an increase in conjugated (direct) bilirubin; however, in practice this differentiation is unsatisfactory. Better appreciation of the source of the jaundice is gained from bile acid measurements.  Bile acid levels increase when hepatic anion transport is impaired, usually during liver dysfunction (bile acids are more sensitive than bilirubin to hepatic impairment) and in the presence of a portosystemic shunt (congenital or acquired). The latter condition is characterized by a marked increase in bile acid concentration after feeding, from a fasting concentration that may be normal. It also increases in bile duct obstruction; very little increase is seen in feline infectious peritonitis or mild cases of hepatic lipidosis. Very high levels can sometimes be seen without structural histologic changes. The reason for this is not known.  Cholesterol level increases due to fatty meals, hepatic or biliary disease, protein-losing nephropathy (and other protein-losing syndromes to some extent), diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism. It decreases in some cases of severe liver dysfunction and occasionally in hyperthyroidism.  Lactate dehydrogenase is a ubiquitous enzyme with a number of isoenzymes; electrophoretic separation of isoenzymes is necessary to locate the source of increased activity. It is therefore of very limited value in general clinical practice.  Sorbitol dehydrogenase level increases in acute hepatocellular damage in horses but is a very labile analyte.  α-Amylase level increases in acute pancreatitis but in dogs is also increased in chronic renal dysfunction. It is therefore of limited use in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity is now the test of choice for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats. Amylase is not a useful indicator of pancreatitis in cats.  Lipase level increases in acute pancreatitis in dogs (longer half-life than amylase) and also occasionally in chronic renal dysfunction. Lipase (routine assay) is not a useful indicator of pancreatitis in cats.  Immunoreactive trypsin (trypsin-like immunoreactivity) level decreases in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs. It will also increase (irregularly) in pancreatitis.  Tests for Pancreatic Disease: Pancreatitis: Serum amylase and lipase activities have been used for several decades to diagnose pancreatitis in both people and dogs. Unfortunately, neither of these tests is both sensitive and specific for pancreatitis in dogs. In one study, significant serum amylase and lipase activities remained after total pancreatectomy, indicating there are sources of serum amylase and lipase activity other than the exocrine pancreas. Also, clinical data suggest a specificity for pancreatitis of only ~50% for both of these markers. Many nonpancreatic diseases, such as renal, hepatic, intestinal, and neoplastic diseases, can lead to increases in serum amylase and lipase activities. Steroid administration can also increase serum lipase activity and cause variable responses in serum amylase activity. Thus, in dogs, measurement of serum amylase and lipase activities are of limited usefulness for diagnosis of pancreatitis. Serum amylase and/or lipase activities that are 3–5 times the upper limit of the reference range, in animals with clinical signs consistent with pancreatitis, are suggestive of such a diagnosis. However, it is important to note that ~50% of dogs that fulfill these criteria do not have pancreatitis. In cats, serum amylase and lipase activities are of no clinical value for diagnosis of pancreatitis. Although cats with experimental pancreatitis can show an increase in serum lipase activity and a decrease in serum amylase activity, these changes are not consistent in cats with spontaneous pancreatitis. In one study of 12 cats with severe forms of pancreatitis, not a single cat had serum lipase or amylase activity above the upper limit of the reference range.  Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentration measures mainly trypsinogen, the only form of trypsin circulating in the vascular space of healthy individuals. However, trypsin, if present in the serum, is also detected by these assays. Serum TLI concentrations can be measured by species-specific assays that have been developed and validated for both dogs and cats. In healthy animals, serum TLI is low, but during pancreatitis an increased amount of trypsinogen leaks into the vascular space, which can lead to an increase in serum TLI concentration. Trypsin that has been prematurely activated may also contribute to this increase. However, both trypsinogen and trypsin are quickly cleared by the kidneys. In addition, any prematurely activated trypsin is quickly removed by proteinase inhibitors, such as α1-proteinase inhibitor and α2-macroglobulin. In turn, α2-macroglobulin-trypsin complexes are removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Thus, the serum half-life for TLI is short, and a significant degree of active inflammation is required to increase serum TLI concentration. Because of the limited sensitivity of serum cTLI and fTLI concentrations for canine and feline pancreatitis, respectively, and because only a limited number of laboratories measure these assays routinely, serum TLI concentration is of limited usefulness for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats.  Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration measures the concentration of classical pancreatic lipase in the serum. This is in contrast to serum lipase activity, which measures the enzymatic activity of all triglyceridases present in the serum, regardless of their cellular origin. Assays to measure PLI in canine (cPLI) and feline (fPLI) serum have been developed and validated and are commercially available. Serum PLI is highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function. Also, serum PLI is far more sensitive for diagnosis of pancreatitis than any other diagnostic test currently available.  A patient-side semiquantitative assay for diagnosis of canine pancreatitis is also available. A test spot that is lighter in color than the reference spot suggests that pancreatitis can be excluded. A test spot darker in color than the reference spot raises the suspicion of pancreatitis and should prompt the clinician to measure a serum cPLI concentration in the laboratory.  Other tests for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats have been evaluated, including plasma trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) concentration, urine TAP concentration, urine TAP:creatinine ratio, serum α1-proteinase inhibitor trypsin complex concentration, and serum α2-macroglobulin concentration. However, none has been shown to be of clinical usefulness.  Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: In the past, several fecal tests have been used to diagnose exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Microscopic fecal examination for fat and/or undigested starch or muscle fibers are at best useful to suggest maldigestion. However, in light of wide availability of tests to diagnose EPI, microscopic fecal examination is no longer justified. Fecal proteolytic activity had been used to diagnose EPI in small animals for several decades. Most of these methods, particularly the radiographic film clearance test, are unreliable. One method, which uses pre-made tablets to pour a gelatin agar, is considered most reliable. However, false-positive as well as false-negative results have been reported. The clinical use of fecal proteolytic activity is limited to species for which more specific assays to estimate pancreatic function are not available and in areas where the more accurate and sophisticated tests are not available.  Serum TLI concentration is the diagnostic test of choice for EPI in both dogs and cats. Assays for TLI measure trypsinogen circulating in the vascular space. In healthy animals, only a small amount of trypsinogen is present in serum. However, in dogs and cats with EPI, the number of pancreatic acinar cells is severely decreased. Serum TLI concentration decreases significantly and may even be undetectable. The reference range for TLI in dogs is 5.7–45.2 mcg/L with a cut-off value of ≤2.5 mcg/L considered diagnostic for EPI. Similarly, the reference range for TLI in cats is 12–82 mcg/L, with a cut-off value of ≤8 mcg/L considered diagnostic. Rarely, animals with serum TLI concentrations below the cut-off value for EPI do not have clinical signs of EPI. This is probably because of the functional redundancy of the GI tract. At the same time, many dogs and cats with chronic diarrhea and weight loss have mild decreases in serum TLI concentration. Most of these animals have chronic small-intestinal disease and should be investigated accordingly. However, a small number of these dogs and cats may have EPI. If there is no evidence of small-intestinal disease in such patients, a trial therapy with pancreatic enzymes and reevaluation of serum TLI concentration after 1 mo is indicated.  PLI is also highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function and could be used to diagnose EPI. However, initial studies showed there is a small degree of overlap in serum PLI concentrations between healthy dogs and dogs with EPI, making the measurement of PLI slightly inferior to that of TLI for accurate diagnosis. In view of these findings, PLI assays for both dogs and cats have been optimized toward higher concentrations, and the current assays are no longer suitable for diagnosis of EPI in dogs or cats.  A fecal canine elastase concentration assay has been developed and validated but is inferior to the widely used TLI measurement.  Handling of Samples: Most biochemistry tests can be performed on either serum or heparinized plasma. A few (eg, insulin) require serum, whereas potassium is best measured on heparin plasma separated immediately after collection. Glucose measurement requires fluoride/oxalate plasma. Suitable collection tubes with and without anticoagulant are available commercially. Plastic tubes are satisfactory for blood in anticoagulant, but clotted blood must be collected either into glass tubes or plastic tubes specially coated to prevent the clot from adhering to the vessel walls.  Samples for biochemical analysis should be separated as soon as possible after collection to minimize artifacts caused by hemolysis and leakage of intracellular fluid components (eg, potassium) out of the cells. Samples in anticoagulant may be centrifuged immediately, but clotted samples need at least 30 min to allow the clot to form. Fluoride/oxalate samples hemolyze very readily because the cells can no longer respire, so timely separation is especially important. Proprietary gels or plastic beads assist with separation, and these may be incorporated into the collection tube or added before centrifugation.  Larger bucket-type centrifuges will accept almost any type or size of tube, but the rotors require careful balancing. They should be spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. Dual-purpose, high-speed microhematocrit centrifuges are favored for in-practice use, because they separate samples more quickly and the same machine can be used to measure PCV. However, they can handle only a limited range of small-volume tubes.  Some “gel-tube” products may provide a permanent separation of serum or plasma; otherwise, this must be separated into a fresh tube. The new tube must be adequately labeled. Samples may then be sent to a professional laboratory or analyzed in the practice.  Point-of-Care Tests: A number of biochemical analytes may be estimated in the practice without the need for large analytical instruments.  Total protein level is measured by refractometry, using the same instrument as is used to measure urine specific gravity, provided the instrument has a total protein scale. It is also valid for protein measurement of ascitic and pleural fluids. The readout may be in g/dL, in which case multiplying the result by 10 will yield the SI unit of g/L.  Urea level may be estimated by chromatographic reaction strips, which correlate well with standard laboratory methods. A rapid whole-blood color comparison strip is also available, but these read only up to ~20 mmol/L and are thus of limited use. A dedicated reflectance meter for urea estimation is not available.  Glucose meters for use on whole blood are widely available for home use by human diabetic patients. These yield acceptably accurate results on animal blood, although an unexpected hypoglycemia should be confirmed by a professional laboratory. Fresh whole blood may be used, but fluoride blood or plasma is the preferred sample if analysis is not immediate.  Ketone levels may be estimated on either urine (preferred sample) or plasma/serum. This can be achieved by using the ketone patch of a urine dipstick, giving a qualitative result. However, there are a number of point-of-care instruments for measurement of blood glucose and ketone levels, including specifically β-hydroxybutyrate.  Triglyceride levels may be visualized in a plasma or serum sample as lipemia. If the milkiness rises to the top of the tube on storage, chylomicrons are present. Otherwise, the milkiness is caused by triglycerides. This is a qualitative judgment but is nevertheless useful, especially in equine patients.  Bilirubin level may also be appreciated by eye in most species. Equine and bovine plasma is normally yellow, which makes determination problematic, but in other species, any yellow color is abnormal and indicates an increased bilirubin level. Visual assessment of the depth and shade of color may provide additional information.  Other point-of-care tests include C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammation and cardiac troponin as a marker for cardiac muscle damage.  For emergency in-clinic use, the most important analytes beyond these simple basics are sodium and potassium. A dedicated ion-specific electrode meter is the best way to measure these. Instruments are available that can analyze whole blood, although great care must be taken to avoid artifacts due to unappreciated hemolysis. Critical care meters are also available that can estimate a variety of analytes, including glucose, urea, and electrolytes; however, these have not been extensively validated on nonhuman blood, and results should be interpreted with caution.  The Practice Laboratory: Extending in-practice analysis beyond these emergency basics requires a dedicated instrument capable of measuring multiple analytes. Two types are available—those based on transmission/absorbance photometry (wet chemistry) and those based on reflectance photometry (dry-reagent chemistry). Transmission/absorbance photometry is the reference method on which all reference values and interpretive guidelines are based. Reflectance photometry methods do not always compare well with the reference method and are best confined to simpler tests such as glucose and urea. For wider applications, such as enzyme analysis, wet chemistry instruments are preferred.  In-clinic analysis is inevitably more expensive than the same investigations done by a professional laboratory, and the range of analytes available is more restricted. Additionally, the level of accuracy or reliability is likely to be lower. Therefore, it is still best practice to regard in-practice analysis as an interim emergency investigation, with the results to be confirmed as appropriate by a professional laboratory. Detailed case laboratory evaluation of nonemergency patients is best referred to a professional laboratory from the outset, for reasons of cost, accuracy, range of analytes available, and the assistance of the clinical pathologist in interpretation of the results.  If in-clinic analysis is to be relied on for general case laboratory evaluation, meticulous attention must be paid to quality assurance. Samples of known composition must be run at least daily for each analyte, in both normal and pathologic ranges; unless these are within the tolerance limits, no patient samples should be tested. Participation in an external quality assessment program is also strongly recommended. Employing a trained technician will address some of these issues but has implications for availability of results during off hours and holidays. The veterinarian in charge of the laboratory is responsible for all the results issued and incurs a legal liability to prove accuracy and reliability. If these cannot be guaranteed to the same standard as a referral laboratory, then results should not be relied on without external confirmation. Cytology ByTrevor J.

This discussion is a brief guide to enable practitioners to prepare samples and undertake basic interpretation; it refers mostly to small animals, but the basic principles apply to all species.  Cytology should be considered a guide. Characteristics of the cells may not be sufficient in many instances to yield a definitive diagnosis or indicate the probable behavior of the lesion. These may require examination of the overall architecture of the tissue, for which cytology is not appropriate. If complex, expensive, or life-threatening therapy is being considered, then the diagnosis should if possible be confirmed by histology.  Techniques Full cytologic interpretation requires a good quality sample. A substantial minority of samples collected by practitioners are unsuitable for full interpretation. The technique appears to be simple, but consistently obtaining good-quality samples requires practice. If samples are sent to a laboratory for interpretation, sending more than one is recommended. In addition, staining and examining one of the preparations in-house helps to monitor the quality of the samples taken and make a provisional diagnosis. This requires a good staining technique and a good quality microscope with a range of objectives, including oil immersion.  Staining: The stains and techniques used for cytology preparations in a practice setting are the same as those used for hematology preparations. The traditional stains for cytology preparations are modified Wright stain (Wright-Giemsa) and May-Grunwald Giemsa. Over the past few years, good-quality rapid Romanowsky stains have been developed for cytology and hematology and are often used by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Many different brands of rapid stain have been developed, so trying a number of products to see which stain is best suited to a practice is recommended. Poor preparations are not always the fault of the collection technique; the stain may be the problem. Stains deteriorate with use and require regular renewal. Many slides can be adjusted by returning a finished stained slide to the stain for deeper color reaction, or if overstained, can have some color removed by placing the slide in alcohol. Formalin-fixed cytology preparations must be stained with either H&E or Papanicolaou stain. If samples are sent to a laboratory for interpretation, the submission form should indicate whether formalin has been added.  Fine-needle Aspiration: The aim of fine-needle aspiration is to obtain a high cell harvest with minimal artifactual damage or blood contamination. The basic sampling kit consists of 21- and 25-gauge needles and 3-, 5-, and 10-mL syringes. Precise technique and choice of equipment depends on physical characteristics of the lesion and whether blood contamination is a problem.  The basic technique uses a 25-gauge needle and a 10-mL syringe. The needle is inserted into the lesion and repeatedly redirected to sample a number of areas while applying a small amount of suction on the syringe. Suction is released before withdrawing the needle. If suction is continued on withdrawal, the cell sample is violently sucked into the barrel of the syringe, causing cell rupture. Sample size is often very small and may be present only within the lumen of the needle and not in the syringe. When the sample has been obtained, the syringe is removed, filled with air, reattached, and used to gently express the sample onto a clean, dry, glass slide. Expressing the sample forcefully will rupture cells. Another slide is placed on top of the sample and pulled lengthways to spread the sample to a monolayer. Additional pressure should not be applied, because this also may cause rupture of the cells. Thicker areas are not a concern; the edges will often be thin enough to examine individual, nonoverlapping cells. The sample should be air dried as quickly as possible to reduce the effects of shrinkage; a hair dryer can be used for this purpose, but heating the sample must be avoided.  This technique can be adapted to different situations. If blood contamination is a problem, the size of the syringe and amount of suction can be reduced or the syringe removed altogether. This is particularly a problem with bone marrow aspiration but is common with all cytology samples and is thought to be due to excessive suction on the syringe. If blood contamination is unavoidable, the blood can be centrifuged. However, if the sample is directly smeared, a feathered edge should be examined, because this is where the heavier cells from the tissue tend to congregate. Blood contamination can often be decreased with the use of a very fine needle (25 gauge); this increases the chance of collecting enough cells for interpretation.  An alternative technique uses a needle without a syringe; no difference in the cell harvest between these two techniques has been shown. The needle is inserted without the syringe and repeatedly redirected to sample different depths and directions within the lesion. The cells are detached by the cutting edge of the needle and enter the needle lumen by capillary action. After withdrawal of the needle, a syringe containing air is reattached and used to gently express the sample. This technique is also particularly useful to sample fragile cells, such as lymphoid cells from lymph nodes. A far better cell harvest is obtained from splenic lesions with this technique than by applying suction. In addition, there is greater sensitivity in placement of the needle, which is especially useful for small lesions.  Certain tissues tend to give a very low cell harvest. These are usually composed of mesenchymal cells (connective tissue) that tightly adhere to each other and therefore do not exfoliate easily. For these lesions, a larger bore needle and increased suction may be necessary. However, a needle with a bore >21 gauge tends to provide a tissue core more suitable for histologic interpretation than cytology.  Impression Smears: Impression smears are often used for ulcerated surface lesions. They are of limited value, because they usually sample only the surface inflammatory exudate and rarely include cells from deeper tissues. A better use of this technique is at the time of biopsy to allow an immediate assessment of the lesion before fixation and processing of the tissue sample. The cut surface of the excised sample is blotted a number of times to remove surface blood and serum, and the dried surface is applied to a clean, dry slide with gentle pressure. A number of areas can be prepared on a single slide. The preparations should be quickly air dried and then stained.  Body Fluid Evaluation: Once a body fluid (eg, urine, pleural or peritoneal fluid) is obtained, a cytospin preparation is by far the best method of cell concentration. However, few practices have access to a cytospin, so centrifugation of the preparation and sampling of the centrifuged sediment is the usual method of cell concentration. Once the slide has been prepared, it should be rapidly air dried before staining.  If the fluid is to be sent to a laboratory, adding a few drops of formalin (the concentration is not critical) helps preserve cells and prevent bacterial overgrowth during transit. Severe bacterial overgrowth obscures the cells, and their metabolic products tend to destroy cells in cytology preparations. This is particularly useful for bronchoalveolar lavage samples and urine, which often contain infectious agents and are prone to bacterial contamination at sampling. The laboratory must be advised of the presence of formalin, which excludes the use of Romanowsky stains. Adding EDTA to help preserve cytology samples is often recommended, but the effect is minimal.  Cells in CSF samples degenerate very quickly and are usually present in very low numbers. Cytospin preparations are almost essential for CSF examination; this can usually be achieved only in a reference laboratory. The addition of a few drops of 10% formalin preserves the cells in CSF very well during transit.  Interpretation of Cytology Samples Cytology interpretation can be guided by an algorithm that also covers the common questions asked by clinicians. From a clinical viewpoint, it is often not necessary to complete all stages of this algorithm. For example, a simple differentiation of inflammation from neoplasia may be sufficient to allow a decision on the next stage of case management. Full cytology interpretation may require the services of a diagnostic laboratory, and a definitive diagnosis often requires histopathology. Some lesions cannot be definitively diagnosed by cytology. If in doubt or if the cytologic interpretation does not correlate with the clinical picture, histology is essential for full interpretation. Whenever the diagnosis is in doubt, biopsy is indicated.  Cytology algorithm   Cytology algorithm Algorithm to interpret cytology samples.  Inflammation: Recognition of basic inflammatory cells—neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells—is essential for interpretation of cytology samples. Some tumors contain a large number of inflammatory cells, but these are very uncommon, even when there is tumor necrosis. The presence of only inflammatory cells in a sample usually indicates a primary inflammatory lesion. Ulceration produces inflammation on the surface of neoplastic lesions, but even in this case the inflammatory cells typically do not extend deeply into the underlying neoplasm. A small percentage of mast cell tumors, however, are composed almost entirely of inflammation, hemorrhage, and edema with only a small number of mast cells. These can be difficult to identify even by histology.  Neutrophils: These are the first cells to arrive in an area of inflammation, and they continue to be attracted to the site as long as the inflammatory stimulus lasts. Large numbers of neutrophils indicate acute inflammation and often are accompanied by smaller numbers of macrophages. This pattern is most often caused by infection or foreign body reaction, including furunculotic reactions directed against hair and keratin embedded in the soft tissue. If fluids are not examined immediately, bacteria, if present, will begin to proliferate, but phagocytosis of bacteria does not occur after sampling. Therefore, if the bacteria are truly pathogenic, they should be within the cytoplasm of the phagocytic cells. The cells’ cytoplasm may contain RBCs, tissue debris, or foreign material.  Macrophages: Macrophages arrive at a site of inflammation within 2–3 hr and are not necessarily an indicator of chronicity, although they often increase with time. They phagocytize bacteria and also larger structures, such as fungi, cellular debris, and foreign material. These cells are often associated with tissue destruction.  Macrophages come from circulating monocytes and have variable morphology. In the tissue, the cytoplasm greatly enlarges over time and usually becomes vacuolated. The nuclei become rounded. If a macrophage exhibits vacuolation or phagocytosis, it is often described as activated. They can be multinucleated, especially with foreign body reactions and in longstanding lesions. Under certain circumstances, they may become epithelioid. These cells have oval or round nuclei and small, often indistinct, nucleoli. Their cytoplasm is expanded but uniformly stained and not vacuolated. They can look epithelial, and great care must be taken when interpreting such cells. However, they do not normally form clusters, which is a key factor in differentiation from epithelial cells.  Macrophages are almost always seen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (they come from the alveoli) and body cavity fluids (part of the modification process), joints (a normal component but increased in disease), and cyst contents (a nonspecific reaction).  Eosinophils: Eosinophils have segmented nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. They vary slightly between species and are generally slightly larger than neutrophils. In cytology preparations, it can occasionally be difficult to distinguish poorly stained eosinophils from neutrophils, because the granules can become indistinct and the cytoplasm of degenerating neutrophils become more acidic, giving a more eosinophilic staining reaction. They are often seen in association with mast cells. Eosinophils are associated with allergies and also are prominent in parasitic diseases, superficial cutaneous viral infection in cats, and fungal infections. They are the predominant cell type in specific eosinophilic conditions such as eosinophilic granuloma in cats (rarely in dogs), canine eosinophilic folliculitis and furunculosis, and eosinophilic collagenolytic granuloma in horses. Some cases of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors have a very high proportion of eosinophils and very few mast cells (<5% of cases).  Of the most commonly encountered veterinary species, rabbits and guinea pigs have inflammatory cells equivalent to neutrophils in other species, but have eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. These are called heterophils. They can be difficult to distinguish from eosinophils. The cellular equivalent to neutrophils in birds and reptiles are also heterophils with eosinophilic granules.  Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are usually small with very little cytoplasm and smudged chromatin with no nucleoli. The almost-round nuclei are similar in size to those of red cells. RBCs are often present in cytology preparations, where they can be used as a comparative and absolute scale. RBCs vary slightly with species; in dogs, RBCs are ~7 microns in diameter. Medium and large lymphocytes, which have a slightly more open chromatin pattern and more cytoplasm, can also be seen in inflammatory processes. Along with plasma cells, lymphocytes are part of the chronic inflammatory response and tend to arrive in tissue a few days after the acute inflammation has begun. However, they are not specific for a particular stimulus and are mostly small lymphocytes. If mostly medium to large cells are present, lymphoma is a possibility. However, even large lymphoblastic cells can be seen in low numbers in inflammatory processes. Normal and reactive lymphocytes in body fluids often appear larger than the same cells from soft tissue.  Multinucleated Cells: These cells are large and have larger numbers of nuclei with one to three small nucleoli and vacuolated cytoplasm. They develop from macrophages (see above) and tend to appear late in the course of inflammation. The cytoplasm should be examined for the presence of fungal organisms and for foreign material. These cells are usually seen in small numbers mixed with other inflammatory cells as part of a granulomatous reaction. Multinucleated cells are much less specific in birds and reptiles, in which they are common in many focal inflammatory lesions, irrespective of cause, and can appear quite early in the inflammatory process.  Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts are not inflammatory cells, but they are frequently seen in association with inflammation. They will proliferate as part of the repair reaction associated with any tissue damage and appear in an inflammatory lesion after ~2 days. Classically, fibroblasts and fibrocytes are elongated cells with pointed tails of cytoplasm. They have round or oval nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, and moderate amounts of uniform, pale blue-staining cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic boundaries are indistinct, giving a “wispy” appearance. When fibroblasts are aspirated from tissue, the cells often become round and lose their spindle shape, but a small number, especially cells in groups, retain their elongated shape. Reactive fibroblasts cannot be definitively distinguished cytologically from low-grade spindle cell tumors. If found in association with inflammatory cells, spindle cells are most often reactive. If found in large clumps with no apparent stimulus, they are more often neoplastic (but neoplasia cannot be excluded). Because fibroblasts and fibrocytes are the principal connective tissue cell, they are tightly adherent to each other, and cell harvest tends to be low.  Neoplasia: Inflammatory lesions are characterized by cells from different populations. The presence of cells that are predominantly of the same population indicates normal tissue, hyperplasia, or neoplasia. Ideally, the first stage in evaluation of a cytologic sample for neoplasia is to determine the tissue type from which the cells have come. If this is not possible, it is necessary to simply determine the likely behavior of the cells. This can often be done without specifically identifying the cell type. The following checklist includes features that can be examined to determine tissue type and likely behavior of the lesion: 1) cell numbers, 2) cell distribution within the smear, 3) cell shape, 4) nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, 5) pleomorphism (both nuclear and cytoplasmic), 6) number, shape, and size of nucleoli, and 7) cytoplasmic content such as melanin, metachromatic granules, fat, etc. Classification of the cell type and likely behavior may require a tissue biopsy. With few exceptions, histology will be necessary for a definitive diagnosis and is always necessary to assess mitotic index and to grade a tumor.  There are three basic tissue types: epithelial, mesenchymal (supporting or connective tissue), and round cells.  Epithelial Cells: Mammary carcinoma, dog   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Epithelial cells are round, cuboidal, or polygonal and tend to adhere tightly to each other and exfoliate in clusters or sheets. They have a sharp cytoplasmic outline and exfoliate in moderate numbers. Cells with more than one nucleus are uncommon.  Mesenchymal Cells: Mesenchymal, or spindle, cells   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Mesenchymal cells are tightly adherent and usually exfoliate in low numbers as single cells or small aggregates. They are classically spindle shaped but usually round up and become plump when removed from the body, particularly when they are lying singly within the smear. The spindle shape is often more apparent in small aggregates. They tend to appear “wispy” because of indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries. Binucleate cells are not uncommon.  Round Cells: Round cells (plasmacytoma)   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Round cells have little or no adherence in the body. They typically exfoliate in large numbers and lie individually in the smear without clumping. Cells of this category include mast cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and cells of transmissible venereal tumors.  Tumor Evaluation: To distinguish benign from malignant tumors, the amount of variation in certain characteristics within the cell population must be assessed. In general, the more malignant the cell, the less differentiated it becomes and the more variation there is in the cell morphology. Benign tumors have cells that are often uniform in size with a uniform nucleus:cytoplasm ratio; they strongly resemble or are identical to the cell of origin. The more malignant the cells become, the more variation is seen in these criteria. Nuclear criteria are the major indicators of malignancy.  Criteria for malignancy include the following: variation in cell size and shape, increased cell exfoliation, increased nuclear size, increased nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, variation in nuclear size and an increase in multinucleated cells, increased mitosis with abnormal mitotic figures, a coarse and often clumped chromatin pattern, altered shape of the nucleus due to close approximation of a nucleus from an adjacent cell (nuclear moulding), and large and often multiple nucleoli of irregular and abnormal shape. There are a number of exceptions to these indicators; in such situations, histology is essential for full interpretation.  The following are some exceptions to the rules of interpretation:  Thyroid carcinomas usually have fairly uniform, well-differentiated cells. A diagnosis of carcinoma can be made simply on the size of the mass in dogs (tumors >3 cm are automatically considered malignant) but not in cats. Major features of malignancy, such as capsular, soft-tissue invasion and vessel invasion, can only be identified histologically. Other tissues in which it may be impossible to differentiate benign from malignant cells include apocrine gland carcinomas, basal cell tumors, melanomas, and proliferative lesions of the liver.  Unlike most malignant tumors, lymphoma is commonly characterized by a uniform population of cells that are larger than normal lymphoid cells. Therefore, variation in morphology is not necessary for a diagnosis of malignancy with this tissue type. If there is marked variation and small lymphocytes are present, then that is more typical of hyperplasia.  Some normal structures, such as hepatoid glands, have more than one cell type (reserve and terminal cells) and can therefore show variation in morphology, and benign tumors of hepatoid glands can have a similar mixture. Nuclear morphology, however, maintains benign features.  Many mammary tumors can show marked variation in cell morphology but histologically would be classified as benign. Indicators of mammary tumor behavior are architectural features, such as local tissue invasion and invasion of vessels. These cannot be assessed using cytology. These exceptions often make cytologic interpretation unreliable, particularly for these types of tissues.  Most spindle cell tumors do not metastasize but are locally aggressive and often difficult to remove. The criteria for malignancy are often less important with respect to the behavior of these tumors than for the epithelial tumors.  Common Cytology Results: Some specific features of cytology preparations can provide a more accurate interpretation of the sample. Listed below are some common results and their interpretation.  Mature Fat Cells: Fat cells, typical balloon-like, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Fat cells, folded and overlapping, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Mature fat cells are seen in benign lipomas and mature body fat. It is not possible to differentiate these cytologically. Fat cells are mesenchymal cells, and because they tend not to exfoliate well, they are usually present in low numbers. If a sample has come from the center of a nodular mass, fat cells are diagnostic for lipoma. These clear-staining, balloon-like cells are often in clusters, folded, and overlapping.  Spindle Cells: It is usually not possible to differentiate reactive spindle cells from those of spindle cell neoplasia. Indicators of neoplasia include absence of a reactive stimulus, such as inflammation or hemorrhage, and a higher cell population with more numerous and larger clumps of cells. Greater variation in cell morphology indicates more aggressive behavior. When removed from their tissue, they often round up and can be mistaken for round cells, but there are usually some distinctly spindle cells in most preparations.  Keratin: Keratin, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Keratin clump, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Keratin includes nucleated and terminally differentiated non-nucleated squamous epithelial cells. Keratin can be a contaminant from the surface of the skin of the animal or the skin of all handlers of the sample and is a common artifact. It can also be sampled from cutaneous keratin-filled cysts, which are always benign and very common, particularly in dog skin. Large, densely packed clumps of keratin in restricted areas in the center of the slide suggest that keratin is not an artifact but has been sampled from the lesion.  Blood: Blood is a common artifact of fine-needle aspiration but can also come from blood-filled spaces in tissue. These can be non-neoplastic, such as hematomas, aneurysms, or severe bruising, or neoplastic lesions such as hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. The presence of spindle cells does not adequately differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic causes of hemorrhage ( see Tumor Evaluation:). Spindle cells produce the neoplastic blood vessels in hemangiosarcomas, but especially in young dogs, they can occasionally produce a very cellular capsule to a soft-tissue hematoma. The capsule contains very active fibroblasts, but they are not neoplastic. Blood that has come directly from the vascular system normally contains significant numbers of platelets. Using a 25-gauge needle can help decrease blood contamination. Blood is almost always seen in aspiration from parenchymatous organs, such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bone marrow.  No Cells: Lack of cells is a common problem of fine-needle aspiration. If the technique is practiced properly, absence of cells can indicate mesenchymal cell proliferation (including lipomas), because these structural cells within the body are tightly adherent cells that do not exfoliate well.  Cells with Cytoplasmic Granules: The most important type among cells with cytoplasmic granules is the mast cell, given that mast cell tumors are common in dogs. These are medium-sized cells with round nuclei. With Romanowsky stains, the granules are dark blue or purple, small (about the size of bacteria), and usually found in large numbers in the cytoplasm. Less-differentiated mast cells have fewer granules. Cytology cannot be used to grade mast cell tumors; grading always requires histology, because it does not depend on only cell morphology. The cells are fragile, and often there are large numbers of granules in the background that have been released from damaged cells. In dogs, eosinophils are often present and very occasionally can be the dominant cell type; however, they are less common in other species. Mast cell tumors in horses have similar cytology to those in dogs, but in cats the cells in mast cell tumors are often smaller, more uniform, and have less distinct granulation.  Thyroid cells can also have dark granules, usually blue or black. These tyrosine granules are very small, low in number, and can be difficult to see. Larger black granules are associated with melanomas. Cytology cannot differentiate benign from malignant melanomas; however, melanomas on haired skin in dogs are usually benign and those on nonhaired areas, such as the lips, feet, and mouth, are usually malignant. Basal cell tumors also often contain cells with melanin, especially in cats. These tumors are usually benign and cytologically can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from melanomas. Melanin can also be seen in macrophages (melanophages), sometimes in large amounts, but it is usually in much larger clumps within the cytoplasm rather than fine granules that are seen in melanocytes. Very fine magenta granules can sometimes be seen in osteoblastic cells from osteosarcoma. Golden, granular material accumulates in the cytoplasm of macrophages when there has been hemorrhage into soft tissue (hemosiderophages). Liver cells can sometimes contain bile, which stains very dark, and occasionally long, thin strands of dark material can be seen where canaliculi have become filled with bile.  Cells with Cytoplasmic Vacuoles: A large, single vacuole is seen in fat cells. In normal or benign cells, the nuclei are small and often indistinct, and the cells are often folded like a collapsed ball. Smaller cells with larger, more prominent nuclei and some cytoplasm in addition to clear, often small vacuoles are more suggestive of malignancy.  Cells with multiple, small vacuoles with a foamy appearance include macrophages, sebaceous glandular cells, and salivary cells. It can be very difficult to differentiate these; the site and other clinical features can be a deciding factor in interpretation.  Differentiation of Round Cell Tumors: Round cell tumors include mast cells, plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytic cells, and transmissible venereal tumor cells. Mast cells have distinctive granules within the cytoplasm and are usually easily identified; if they are the dominant cell type, this is diagnostic for a mast cell tumor. In rare cases, mast cells can have few or no granules in the cytoplasm. Lymphoid cells classically have a very high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio; few other cells have this feature. Neoplastic, lymphoid cells are medium size to large, with a nucleus at least 1.5 times the size of an erythrocyte. Nucleoli are often multiple, sometimes quite prominent. However, the rare cases of small-cell lymphoma have cells indistinguishable from normal lymphocytes.  Cells of a histiocytoma (Langerhans cells) are not especially histiocytic cytologically. They are round cells with a small to moderate amount of pale-staining cytoplasm. They are fairly uniform and have nuclei that are eccentric within the cell. Nucleoli are indistinct. True histiocytic cells are slightly more problematic to interpret. These are part of the cell line that includes the antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and Langerhans cells, but can range from inflammatory and reactive cells to highly malignant round cell tumors. They tend to be larger than the other round cells with more cytoplasm, sometimes are vacuolated, and can have oval or indented nuclei. Infiltrates of histiocytic cells are often problematic, even with a full-tissue biopsy examination, and always require histologic examination to assess behavior.  Histiocytoma, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Neoplastic plasma cells include cells of myeloma. These are usually well differentiated and have most of the characteristics of normal plasma cells. When neoplastic, they are found in large numbers with few other cell types present. Benign nodular proliferations of plasma cells, plasmacytomas, show more marked pleomorphism and often differ markedly from normal plasma cells. Many have a slightly histiocytic appearance, and these can be difficult to distinguish cytologically. These cells have a round nucleus and a coarse chromatin pattern, which sometimes becomes clumped around the nuclear membrane. The nucleus is often eccentric with an intensely basophilic cytoplasm and paranuclear pale Golgi zone.  Cells of transmissible venereal tumors tend to have a moderate amount of cytoplasm (more than found in lymphoblasts), often with small vacuoles. Nuclear chromatin is coarse, with one or two fairly prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are often numerous. Unlike most cytology preparations of neoplastic lesions, they tend to have moderate variation in the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio.  Cytology of Specific Sites: Lymph Nodes: Normal, hyperplastic, and early neoplastic lymph nodes have a mixed population of cells. Cells are predominantly small lymphocytes with variable numbers of medium and large lymphoid cells and some plasma cells. A uniform population of cells indicates neoplasia. Lymph node aspirates often have a population of cells that are much paler staining and larger, with some cells completely losing their cytoplasm. These cells are in varying stages of degeneration and should be ignored. Size in comparison with RBCs is useful. Normal mature lymphocytes or small neoplastic lymphocytes (rare) have nuclei the same size as RBCs. However, neoplastic lymphoid cells have nuclei at least 1.5 times the diameter of RBCs. Lymphomatous lymph nodes may still contain a significant number of normal lymphoid cells. The proportion of smaller mature lymphocytes must then be compared with the larger immature cells to differentiate hyperplasia from neoplasia. The proportion considered significant varies, but in general, most cytologists consider a diagnosis of lymphoma when immature cells are >50% of the cell population. Some cytologists require a higher percentage of immature cells, particularly if there is only one lymph node enlarged. If there is doubt, a biopsy should be performed. Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis is essential if therapy for lymphoma is considered and is always needed for full grading.  Submandibular lymph nodes are often difficult to assess. They drain the buccal and nasal areas and are subject to strong antigenic stimuli. They frequently undergo hyperplasia, often histologically atypical, especially in cats. Cats also develop unusual neoplastic conditions affecting this node, such as the T cell–rich B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin-like lymphoma, both of which have a majority of normal lymph node cells. For these reasons, great care must be taken in the interpretation of lesions involving the submandibular lymph nodes, because false-negative and false-positive results for neoplasia are not uncommon.  Aspirates from suspected enlarged submandibular lymph nodes often yield only large foamy cells, which are salivary cells. This result can be due either to sampling error or to hypertrophy of the salivary gland in cases of sialoadenosis. The cause of sialoadenosis is not understood, but a significant minority of submandibular aspirates contain only these cells.  Body Cavity Fluids: Meaningful analysis of fluids from body cavities requires total protein (measured with a handheld refractometer), total cell count, and a differential of cell types present ( see Table: Characteristics of Transudates and Exudate). Pure transudates are rare, because they rapidly become modified by leakage of fluid from lymphatics or blood vessels and attraction of mixed inflammatory cells. Transudates attract activated macrophages with varying numbers of nondegenerate neutrophils. The lymphocytes that may also be present are classified as small, but most look slightly larger than circulating lymphocytes and are part of the reactive process of the fluid in the body cavity. In addition, when fluid accumulates in the body cavity, the lining mesothelial cells proliferate and are shed into the fluid. These cells are large, often multinucleated, vary in appearance, and often are seen in groups with large nucleoli. They sometimes form grape-like clusters with a narrow, pale space between the cells. These features are usually considered to be associated with malignancy, but in this case, the cells are simply reactive and not neoplastic. Care must be taken to differentiate these mesothelial cells from neoplastic cells within the body fluid. A small number of these cells typically have a corona around the cytoplasmic envelope (giving a fuzzy outline); this is a distinguishing feature of mesothelial cells.  Table Characteristics of Transudates and Exudate Mesothelial cells can be present in very large numbers, especially in pericardial fluid. Malignant mesotheliomas are rare in domestic species, but it is not possible to differentiate neoplastic from reactive mesothelial cells on cytologic examination. The degree of polyploidy is not a distinguishing feature.  Mixed inflammatory cells increase in number as a transudate becomes modified and are present in large numbers in an exudate. Mesothelial cells would be expected in this type of sample, and it can therefore be useful to look for a second population when checking for neoplasia. Smoothly demarcated aggregates of atypical cells with no narrow spaces between the cells may indicate a second population of carcinoma cells.  Tracheal or Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Respiratory epithelial cells are seen in BAL from healthy and diseased animals. The epithelial cells may retain their original structure with a ciliated surface and basal nuclei, but they often appear round with indistinct cilia.  Macrophages are usually the dominant inflammatory cell type in BAL from healthy animals. These come from deep in the alveoli and are part of the normal defense mechanisms. They greatly increase with fluid accumulation in the lung (eg, cardiovascular insufficiency) and in inflammatory conditions, where they are accompanied by other inflammatory cells. Debris, foreign material, hemosiderin, RBCs, and microorganisms can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm of these cells. Macrophages containing hemosiderin in people are called heart failure cells, but their cause is less specific in domestic species. There are increased numbers of macrophages in many subacute and chronic lung disorders.  In healthy dogs and cats, neutrophils contribute <5% of cells in BAL preparations. Neutrophils are nonspecific inflammatory cells in the respiratory system and do not necessarily indicate infection. They can be the most numerous cells in an inflammatory reaction, even in cases of allergy. However, when neutrophils are present, the cytoplasm should always be examined carefully for the presence of any infectious agent. Bacteria can also sometimes be seen in the extracellular parts of the smear, but extracellular bacteria are often contaminants from the pharynx.  Great care must be taken to differentiate eosinophils from neutrophils in BAL preparations because the granules are often faint and difficult to identify. Eosinophils can comprise up to 5% of cells in BAL from healthy dogs but may reach 10% in healthy cats. Eosinophils that comprise >10% of cells indicate an allergic respiratory disease, although lungworms and heartworms can also cause this reaction. With lungworm infestation, larvae are sometimes present as large coiled structures.  Nucleated and nonnucleated squamous cells are commonly seen in BAL preparations and are often associated with bacteria on the cell surface. This indicates contamination from the pharynx. Bacteria are normal inhabitants of the pharynx, in particular Simonsiella, which are very large, ladder-like organisms. Their presence confirms contamination from the pharynx. If bacteria are present along with squamous epithelial cells, it may not be possible to conclude whether the bacteria are from the respiratory tree or the pharynx. Bacteria in the cytoplasm of neutrophils confirms a significant infection.  Synovial Fluid: Full examination of synovial fluid should include protein content, mucin clot formation, viscosity, cell count and differential, and direct cytologic examination. It is usually not feasible to perform all of these tests in a practice setting, but cytologic examination and physical examination can usually give a good estimate of the results of most of these tests. Cytology, therefore, is the most useful single test in synovial fluid examination.  Sampling technique requires the following equipment: a 3-mL syringe, a 21- or 25-gauge needle, clean glass slides, and various collection tubes (plain, EDTA, and heparin). This technique always requires a degree of sedation, and a sterile technique is essential. Each joint has a recommended site for aspiration (beyond the scope of this discussion) and generally requires slight flexion or hyperextension. The needle attached to the syringe is slowly advanced into the joint space and, taking care not to scratch the articular surface, gentle suction is applied. Normal joint fluid is viscous and sticky and of small volume. The volume of fluid, however, depends on the size of the animal, the joint sampled, and the degree of effusion into the joint. When sample size is sufficient, it is essential to release the suction on the syringe before withdrawing the needle.  Sample handling is critical; because many tests can be performed on synovial fluid, and cytology is the most important, sometimes the sample volume is so small that no other test is possible. Therefore, a plain smear should always be made and quickly air dried as soon as the sample is obtained. Most tests can be performed on samples without anticoagulant (a plain red-topped tube), or the sample can be left in the sampling syringe. However, blood contamination, hemarthrosis, and inflammatory effusion introduce fibrin into the joint, and the sample may clot. Placing part of the sample into an EDTA tube can prevent this, but EDTA can interfere in the mucin clot test and, for this reason, a heparinized sample may also be necessary.  Results of cytology preparations can indicate the number of cells present, the type of cell and the differential, the presence of tumor cells, and the presence of bacteria. They can also give an indication of viscosity. In fluid of normal or increased viscosity, cells tend to align in rows in the direction of the smearing; this is described as windrowing.  In healthy animals, cell counts vary widely (eg, 0–4,400/mL in dogs), but they are usually very low. Counts >500/mL in dogs generally indicate a significant increase. Normal synovial fluid contains ~2 cells/high-powered field (400X magnification). In the vast majority of cases where there is an increased cell content, cell numbers are either low (up to 4 or 5 cells/high-powered field) in degenerative joint disease or very high in septic or autoimmune arthritis. Intermediate equivocal results are extremely uncommon.  Cell types include joint mononuclear cells, which are a mixture of circulating monocytes, tissue macrophages, and synovial lining cells. It is not possible, or even necessary, to differentiate these cells, because they all have a similar morphology and all react to similar stimuli. Cytoplasmic vacuolation of these cells, and especially the presence of phagocytosis of debris or RBCs, indicate activation, a feature not seen in normal joint mononuclear cells. In degenerative joint disease, synovial fluid usually contains only macrophages, occasionally with extremely low numbers of neutrophils.  Hemorrhage is common in synovial preparations but is frequently an artifact. True hemarthrosis provides a synovial fluid sample that is uniformly contaminated with blood at the time of sampling. If the blood contamination occurs at the very end of the sampling procedure with clear fluid initially, this is most likely artifact. In addition, in true hemarthrosis, RBCs may be seen in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Artifactual blood contamination will also introduce WBCs, such as neutrophils, making interpretation of inflammatory cells in the sample difficult, although blood contamination still gives only a low cell number.  Neutrophils are present in large numbers in both septic arthritis and autoimmune joint disease. These two conditions can usually be differentiated by the clinical history. In septic arthritis, bacteria are sometimes found within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells. The absence of bacteria, either within cytology preparations or by culture, does not exclude bacteria as a cause of arthritis. False-negative results for bacteria are not uncommon.  Lymphocytes are often present in very small numbers in inflammatory processes but are not specific for a particular cause.  Osteoclasts are very occasionally seen when there has been erosion of the articular cartilage with exposure of the underlying bone.  Neoplastic cells in joint fluid are rare, although joints can be the site of both primary and secondary tumors.  Macrophages increase with any damage to a joint, especially in cases of degenerative joint disease. Cytoplasmic vacuolation of these cells, and especially the presence of phagocytosis of debris or RBCs, indicate macrophage activation, a feature not seen in normal joint mononuclear cells. In degenerative joint disease, synovial fluid often contains only macrophages.  Nasal Cavity: The cytology of nasal flush preparations is similar to that seen with BAL preparations. A small number of respiratory epithelial cells are usually flushed out along with exudate. A predominance of eosinophils may indicate inhaled allergens, parasites, or fungi and may occasionally indicate bacteria or neoplasia. The presence of eosinophils in the nasal cavity therefore is less indicative of a specific process than in some other sites, eg, the trachea or bronchi.  Neutrophils are the most common exudative cell but, as with BAL, often indicate secondary infection. In the case of intranasal neoplasia, cells with neoplastic characteristics ( see Neoplasia:) may be present, but absence of these cells does not exclude neoplasia. Only a minority of neoplastic processes erode the overlying respiratory epithelium and allow exfoliation of neoplastic cells.  Similarly, absence of fungal hyphae within the preparation does not exclude fungal infection. Unless fungal plaques are sampled directly for both cytology and culture, false-negative results are common. Viral inclusions are rarely seen.  Vaginal Cytology: This can be used to identify the various stages of the canine estrous cycle, but results must be interpreted in conjunction with the animal’s behavior. A sample of exfoliated cells is obtained from the vaginal vault cranial to the urethral orifice with a cotton-tipped swab or glass rod. Cells are gently rolled onto a glass slide, air dried, and stained. Features to be identified include neutrophils, bacteria, RBCs, and the types of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells (in increasing order of differentiation) are parabasal, small and large intermediate cells, and superficial cells. Parabasal cells are small, with central round nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, a relatively narrow band of cytoplasm, and a nucleus:cytoplasm ratio of ~1:1. Small intermediate cells have a similar nucleus but a much larger amount of cytoplasm. Large intermediate cells have a similar nucleus with very large amounts of cytoplasm and an angular, irregular outline. Superficial cells also have large amounts of cytoplasm, but their nuclei are pyknotic (small and contracted) or absent.  The stages of the estrous cycle change gradually. If a preparation does not conform exactly to a specific part of the cycle, judgment must be made regarding what stages are present. In proestrus, all types of epithelial cells are present along with neutrophils, RBCs, and mucus. As proestrus progresses, the epithelial cells increasingly approach terminal differentiation (superficial cells), and neutrophils slowly decrease. Bacteria are often present in large numbers. In estrus, >90% of epithelial cells are superficial cells, with no background mucus. There are large numbers of bacteria, but no neutrophils. In diestrus, parabasal and intermediate cells are >80% of the total epithelial cells. Variable numbers of neutrophils and bacteria are present but usually fewer than in proestrus. It can be difficult to differentiate some stages of proestrus from diestrus. In anestrus, parabasal and intermediate cells predominate. Neutrophils and bacteria are rare. RBCs do not help differentiate the stages of estrus.  Cerebrospinal Fluid: Interpretation of CSF cytology is difficult, because it can be hard to obtain enough well-preserved cells for examination before the sample deteriorates. Cell counts in normal CSF are low (0–5 cells/μL in dogs and 0–8 cells/μL in cats). However, there is a large variation in cell counts between individuals; counts can also vary between cysternal and lumbar taps in the same individual. Because the albumin level of CSF is ~20% of that found in serum, the cells that are present rapidly degenerate. Cell counts should ideally be done and morphology examined within 1 hr of collection.  Because of the low cell numbers, the use of an automated cell counter is usually not appropriate. A hemocytometer can be used for cell counts, and a cytocentrifuge for cytology preparations. A simplified sedimentation technique (description of which is beyond the scope of this discussion) to concentrate cells onto a slide is suitable for practice use. The presence of more than one or two nucleated cells in a plain smear of CSF should be considered potentially significant.  In CSF, an increase in nucleated cells is called pleocytosis. There is tremendous variation and overlap in both the degree of pleocytosis and the types of cells present in both infectious and noninfectious conditions in the CNS. Interpretation should be integrated with the other clinical details of the case. If neutrophils and/or macrophages are present, the cytoplasm of the cells should be searched for bacteria and fungi. The absence of organisms or pleocytosis does not exclude infection, and noninfectious conditions in the CNS can also produce a neutrophilic pleocytosis.  Apart from lymphoma, it is rare to find neoplastic cells in CSF. If noninflammatory cells are present in the CSF, they should be interpreted using the basic principles detailed above.  Urine Cytology: Urine can be examined as a wet preparation or as a dried cytology smear. Because of the absence of staining in a wet preparation, these are better limited to examination for crystals and RBCs. Although nucleated cells may be seen, in most cases they cannot be identified and are better examined using a dried cytology smear.  There are at least 10 common forms of urinary crystals. Identification is not discussed here but may be readily accomplished by use of good reference illustrations. (Also see Urolithiasis in Small Animals.)  Because cells in urine rapidly degenerate, particularly if bacteria are present, centrifuged preparations of urine samples should be examined rapidly after sampling. If this is not possible, boric acid is often added to urine to prevent degeneration and bacterial overgrowth, although its effect may be very limited. If a delay between sampling and examination is likely, a better preservation method is the addition of a few drops of formalin; however,the traditional Romanowsky stains cannot then be used. H&E stain is a better alternative for formalin-fixed samples.  Normal urine usually has very few nucleated cells. Single urothelial cells are occasionally present. Squamous epithelial cells are also seen in urine and come from the terminal urethra, vagina, vulva, and preputial epithelium. Squamous metaplasia of bladder epithelium after chronic inflammation is very rare.  Neoplastic cells in urine samples are almost always epithelial. They are rounded polygonal cells, often clumped, with marked variation in morphology, especially the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio. Uniform cells are more likely to be normal. Mildly pleomorphic cells can be associated with hyperplasia (eg, some cases of polypoid cystitis).  The inflammatory cells seen in cystitis are almost exclusively neutrophils. Eosinophils are seen in some rare, specific inflammatory conditions, but macrophages are very uncommon even in chronic conditions. By far the most common cause of inflammation is infection, so the cytoplasm of the neutrophils should be examined carefully for bacteria. It is very uncommon to see a significant neutrophil component accompanying neoplasia or calculi.  RBCs are commonly seen with neoplastic and inflammatory diseases of the bladder but are also often seen without an indication of other pathology. This can be a sampling artifact but is also a common finding in cases of interstitial cystitis. In cats, this term is often used synonymously with feline urologic syndrome, but interstitial cystitis also is seen in dogs and people, suggesting other unknown pathogenic factors that can cause this condition. Persistent hematuria without cytologic evidence of neoplasia or inflammation may indicate interstitial cystitis.  Also see Urinalysis.  Liver Cytology: Although cytology is a popular method to investigate liver disease, there is disagreement on its usefulness. Blood contamination is found in most samples and may overshadow inflammatory infiltrates by introducing circulating WBCs. Diagnosis of many hepatic diseases relies on architectural features and the distribution of the changes within the liver rather than on the morphology of individual cells. Finally, in some hepatic disorders, hepatocytes proliferate without significant changes in their individual morphology (see below). These factors limit the amount of information that can be obtained from cytology of liver tissue.  Sampling methods are similar to those used for other organs. Sampling is usually performed under guidance of ultrasound, but blind sampling can be performed at the tenth intercostal space at the level of the connection of rib to rib cartilage. Bleeding during this procedure is not a significant risk.  In the healthy liver, hepatocytes are plump, polygonal rounded cells with a diameter of 25–30 microns. Nuclei are central and round with a single large, prominent nucleolus. A few cells are binucleated. There is a large amount of blue-staining cytoplasm that usually appears granular.  Changes in the metabolism of liver cells can be seen within the cytoplasm. The presence of numerous small, discrete vacuoles or one large vacuole indicates accumulation of fat. This has several potential causes and is prominent in feline hepatic lipidosis syndrome, starvation, pregnancy, and diabetes mellitus. Enlarged hepatocytes with a pale granular-staining cytoplasm but no discrete vacuoles are characteristic of excess glycogen storage. This is most often caused by increased levels of circulating steroids.  Bile stasis and pigment accumulation (eg, iron) can also be assessed by examination of the cytoplasm. Hepatocytes normally accumulate lipofuscin pigment, noted as small, fairly uniform, dark-staining granules, whereas bile and often hemosiderin tend to appear as slightly larger dark-staining bodies within the cytoplasm. Bile accumulation within the canaliculae (canalicular plugs) can also occasionally be seen. These appear as black ribbons on the surface of hepatocytes.  Cytologic interpretation of inflammation is difficult because of the inevitable blood contamination of samples. Inflammation should be considered significant only if it is present within clusters of hepatocytes. Although the individual inflammatory cells can be recognized, it is not possible to indicate which part of the liver is principally affected. Neutrophils can be seen in diffuse hepatitis and also in more focal cholangitis. Small, mature inflammatory lymphocytes are usually seen in periportal inflammatory conditions, such as lymphocytic pericholangitis in cats and chronic active hepatitis in dogs. Macrophages can also be seen in the chronic inflammatory conditions and also in certain infections. Phagocytic cells should be investigated for the presence of organisms within the cytoplasm, but this is uncommon in liver disease.  Primary proliferative nodular hepatocellular lesions include regenerative hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, adenoma (hepatoma), and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biliary proliferations can appear as cysts, adenomas, or carcinomas. Bile duct cells tend to be smaller than hepatocytes with less cytoplasm. They are cuboidal or low columnar cells that occasionally produce tubular structures within cytology samples. The cytoplasm is also more uniformly pale staining and not significantly granular. Nucleoli are smaller and less distinct. Significant cell harvest from cystic bile ducts is uncommon because most of these lesions are simply cystic space rather than cellular. If a significant number of biliary epithelial cells are obtained, neoplasia is most likely. However, malignant bile duct cells are more commonly uniform in size and shape and, therefore, do not always show the morphologic features usually associated with malignancy.  Hepatocellular proliferation is a difficult area of interpretation, because hepatocytes in benign proliferative lesions are very similar to those in well-differentiated carcinomas and indeed often cannot be differentiated even from normal hepatocytes. Only in cases with poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells can an adequate interpretation of malignancy be made. The benign and non-neoplastic proliferations always have the same morphology as normal hepatocytes. Therefore, false-negative results for proliferative lesions within the liver are common. Cytology is thus of limited value for nodular hepatocellular lesions.  Cytology can be a useful technique for diagnosis of round cell tumors in the liver. Even with severe inflammatory lesions, lymphocytes are present in low numbers and are generally small, mature lymphocytes. A large population of medium and large lymphoid cells indicates lymphoma. No other condition will give this result.  The other common round cell tumor that can affect the liver (particularly in cats but also occasionally in dogs) is mast cell tumor. The granules within mast cells are metachromatic, facilitating diagnosis. Aspirates of normal liver may contain a few mast cells, but in neoplasia they are usually present in large numbers. If other cells are obtained from cytology preparations, they should be interpreted using the principles described above.  Kidney Cytology: Normal renal aspirates have almost a pure population of renal tubular cells. These are uniform, medium-sized cells of ~17–20 microns with central nuclei, small indistinct nucleoli, and a moderate amount of pale-staining cytoplasm. In cats, lipid droplets within the cytoplasm are a common, normal feature. The cells can be present either singly or in clusters and can occasionally be seen as tubular structures. They sometimes contain small, dark granules within the cytoplasm.  Renal lymphoma is the most common neoplastic disease of the kidney in cats and dogs. Because the cells are usually widely distributed within the tissue, false-negative results with cytologic examination are uncommon. Diagnosis can be made using the criteria described above. Primary renal tumors are uncommon.  Cystic lesions include renal cysts, most commonly seen in cats but also occasionally in dogs, and hydronephrosis. In both disorders, cell harvest is usually low, with a large amount of fluid. The cellular component of the sample is rarely helpful in identifying further the nature of the cystic structure.  Most inflammatory lesions in the kidney are chronic and produce fibrous connective tissue. Cell harvest from these lesions is usually exceedingly low, and cytology is not typically a useful technique. Pyogenic inflammation can sometimes be diagnosed. Cytology may help diagnose feline infectious peritonitis, although diagnosis using serologic techniques is more common. Because of the usually severe and widespread nature of the inflammation, cell harvest is usually high. The wide mixture of inflammatory cells present in feline infectious peritonitis, with a predominance of neutrophils, along with an appropriate history, are typical of the disorder.  Mammary Cytology: Cytology is useful to differentiate inflammatory from neoplastic nodular lesions within mammary tissue. Mammary tumors are not commonly inflamed. It is less useful to differentiate the neoplastic conditions.  Neoplastic lesions must be interpreted using the criteria listed above ( see Neoplasia:). The criteria most useful to determine the behavior and prognosis of a mammary tumor are local tissue and vessel invasion, not cell morphology. These are best assessed histologically rather than cytologically. Therefore, cellular morphology is not necessarily a good guide to tumor behavior. In cats, malignant cells are often uniform and do not exhibit the normal malignant features; the size of the malignant tumor is the most useful prognostic indicator. Clinical Hematology ByTrevor J.

(Also see Hematopoietic System Introduction.)  Red Blood Cells: Three RBC measurements are routinely done: packed cell volume (PCV), the proportion of whole blood volume occupied by RBCs; hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration of whole lysed blood; and RBC count, the number of RBCs per unit volume of whole blood. Although these are separate estimations, they are in effect three ways to measure the same thing, and it is incorrect to attempt to interpret them as separate variables. Inasmuch as they do vary in relation to each other, they allow calculation of two further meaningful parameters, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).   equation  equation MCV varies widely between mammalian species, from ~15 fL in goats to ~90 fL in people. Avian and reptilian red cells are even larger, up to 300 fL. Nevertheless, MCHC varies little with species (or erythrocyte size), at ~330 g/L.  Several artifacts can cause significant and potentially misleading alterations to measured RBC parameters: 1) old samples cause RBCs to swell, thus increasing PCV and MCV and decreasing MCHC; 2) lipemia causes a falsely high Hgb reading, and hence a falsely high MCHC; 3) hemolysis causes PCV to decrease while Hgb remains unchanged, again leading to a falsely high MCHC; 4) underfilling of the tube causes RBCs to shrink, causing PCV and MCV to decrease and MCHC to increase; 5) autoagglutination causes a falsely low RBC count, and hence a falsely high MCV.  Visual description of RBC morphology on a Romanowsky stain also provides useful diagnostic information. The most common terms include 1) normocytic—cells are of normal size; 2) macrocytes—abnormally large cells, usually polychromatophilic; 3) microcytes—abnormally small cells, usually caused by a lack of hemoglobin precursors; 4) anisocytosis—variation in size of cells due to macrocytes, microcytes, or both; 5) normochromic—cells are of normal color; 6) polychromasia—variation in color of the cells, which usually describes the appearance of large, juvenile, bluish-staining polychromatophilic macrocytes (these broadly correspond to the “reticulocyte” seen with new methylene blue staining, in which the reticulum represents the remnants of the nucleus); 7) hypochromasia—decrease in staining density of the cells, usually due to a lack of hemoglobin precursors, especially iron; and 8) annulocyte—extreme form of hypochromic cell with only a thin rim of hemoglobin.  PCV is the variable usually used to assess the basic status of the erythron—increased in polycythemia, decreased in anemia—although if a sample is too hemolyzed to allow measurement of PCV, a meaningful Hgb measurement may still be obtained. RBC count as such should not be interpreted clinically.  An abnormally high PCV (polycythemia) may be relative, due to a change in the proportion of circulating RBCs to blood plasma without any change in the size of the erythron, or absolute, due to a real increase in erythron size. Absolute polycythemia may be primary (eg, polycythemia vera or, rarely, erythropoietin-producing tumors) or secondary (a consequence of disease in another organ system). (Also see Erythrocytosis (Polycythemia).)  Polycythemia vera and erythropoietin-producing tumors should be suspected only when PCV is very high, normally >0.7. The former is characterized by normal, mature RBCs and a normal (or low) erythropoietin concentration, whereas the latter may show a regenerative RBC picture with high erythropoietin concentration. Relative polycythemia may also be associated with very high PCV values, and normal, mature RBCs. Secondary polycythemia generally shows a more modest increase in PCV, often with evidence of regeneration (more so when the cause is pulmonary or cardiac, less so when the cause is hormonal). It is often possible to make the differential diagnosis of polycythemia on clinical grounds.  Abnormally low PCV (anemia) may be caused by loss of blood (hemorrhage), breakdown of RBCs in circulation (hemolysis), or lack of production of RBCs by the bone marrow (hypoplasia or aplasia). Presentation varies according to whether the condition is acute or chronic. Aplastic anemia is always chronic in onset, because anemia occurs gradually as existing cells reach the end of their lifespan. (Also see Anemia.)  In acute hemorrhagic anemia, external blood loss is easily appreciated clinically, but blood loss into a body cavity may be determined only on paracentesis. Initially, all hematologic parameters may be normal, because it may take 12 hr for fluid shifts to produce a decrease in the PCV. Within a few days, RBCs become regenerative, with juvenile forms appearing in circulation (except in horses, in which circulating evidence of regeneration is not readily appreciable). These consist of polychromatophilic macrocytes and normoblasts (nucleated RBCs). Late normoblasts have a small, nonviable nucleus and a moderate amount of cytoplasm colored similarly to that of the polychromatophilic macrocytes, whereas early normoblasts have a larger, viable nucleus and scanty cytoplasm. These are most easily distinguished from lymphocytes by their more densely staining nucleus.  If substantial amounts of blood have been lost from the body, the RBC picture may become hypochromic. Thus, this type of anemia shows an increase in MCV and a decrease in MCHC. If bleeding is into a body cavity, hypochromasia may not be evident because hemoglobin precursors will be recycled. However, slight jaundice may be seen as the sequestered cells are broken down. Some sequestered cells may also be returned to the circulation intact, if somewhat misshapen.  In acute hemolytic anemia, PCV will decrease immediately, and in the early stages some jaundice will be evident. In the very early stages, even a sample collected with extreme care may be markedly hemolyzed. As with hemorrhagic anemia, the RBCs will become regenerative within a few days, with polychromatophilic macrocytes and nucleated RBCs evident. Because hemoglobin precursors are not lost from the body, true hypochromasia is not seen.  Chronic hemorrhagic anemia may be difficult to appreciate if blood is lost in the feces or urine, or due to bloodsucking ectoparasites. Anemia may be severe, and the RBC picture will be regenerative on presentation. Hypochromasia is usually very marked. In very longstanding conditions, depletion of iron and other hemoglobin precursors can become so marked that most of the cells are microcytic, and MCV may paradoxically decrease. Intermittent intra-abdominal hemorrhage leads to a somewhat different picture, because blood shed into the peritoneal cavity can be returned to the circulation. PCV may therefore recover quickly (until the next episode), and signs of depletion of hemoglobin constituents do not emerge.  In chronic hemolytic anemia, RBCs are regenerative on presentation, except that some cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) paradoxically show little or no regeneration until treatment has been initiated. Hypochromasia is less marked than in hemorrhagic conditions, and misshapen RBCs (including target cells and folded cells) are more common. The spherocyte, in which the erythrocyte loses its classic biconcave shape, is essentially pathognomonic for AIHA. Jaundice may be absent, because the products of the destruction of the RBCs may be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and the liver as quickly as they are formed.

Hypoplastic and aplastic anemia may be mild if RBC production is merely depressed secondary to some other disease. Protein, mineral, or vitamin deficiencies may cause hypoplastic anemia, but these are more likely to be secondary to another disease (eg, chronic hemorrhage or malabsorption) than simple dietary deficiency. Other diseases may cause depression of erythropoietin production, eg, renal failure, deficiencies of hormones that usually stimulate erythropoietin production (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism), and chronic, debilitating conditions (eg, chronic infections, chronic parasitism, and neoplasia). RBC morphology is nonregenerative and may be hypochromic if a deficiency state is involved. Paradoxically, vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency produces a macrocytic RBC picture due to early maturation arrest of the erythrocytes. Neoplasia of the bone marrow may cause severe anemia as erythropoietic elements are crowded out, but some regeneration may be seen as the remaining bone marrow attempts to compensate. In this case, other bone marrow cell lines will also be affected.  Nonregenerative anemia, blood smear, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  True aplastic anemia refers to a failure of the entire bone marrow. The shorter-lived granulocytes and platelets decrease first, followed by a progressively severe anemia that is normocytic and normochromic.  White Blood Cells: The WBCs consist of the granulocytes (neutrophils in most mammals, called heterophils in rabbits, reptiles, and birds [and these look like eosinophils in smears]; eosinophils; and basophils) and the agranulocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes). Although each type is traditionally counted by determination of its percentage of the total WBC population, meaningful interpretation requires that the absolute number of each type be calculated by multiplying the total WBC count by the fraction attributable to the individual cell type. Percentages of each cell type alone are not helpful. An increased percentage that is due to an absolute decrease in another cell type is not an increase at all.  Mature neutrophils have a lobulated nucleus, but when demand is high, immature cells with an unlobulated band nucleus (no constriction of the nucleus is more than half the width of the nucleus) may be released into circulation. They function as phagocytes and are important in infectious conditions and in inflammation. Increased neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) are caused by inflammation, bacterial infection, acute stress, steroid effects, and neoplasia of the granulocytic cell line (granulocytic leukemia can be difficult to differentiate from a simple neutrophilia without special stains or bone marrow biopsy). Decreased neutrophil counts (neutropenia) are caused by viral infections, toxin exposure (including foodborne toxins), certain drugs (eg, carbimazole and methimazole), autoimmune destruction of neutrophils, bone marrow neoplasia not involving the granulocytes, and bone marrow aplasia.  Eosinophils are characterized by prominent pink-staining granules on a Romanowsky stain. They inactivate histamine and inhibit edema formation. Increased eosinophil counts (eosinophilia) are caused by allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, parasitism, tissue injury, mast cell tumors, estrus, and pregnancy or parturition in the bitch. Some large dog breeds (eg, German and Belgian Shepherds, Rottweilers) normally have a relatively high eosinophil count. Extremely high eosinophil counts (hypereosinophilic syndrome), possibly due to an out-of-control hypersensitivity reaction, and eosinophil leukemia (a form of chronic myeloid leukemia) are also described. Decreased eosinophil count (eosinopenia) is almost always caused by the action of glucocorticoids, either endogenous or therapeutic.  Basophils are rare in most species and are characterized by blue-staining granules on a Romanowsky stain. They are more easily seen in cattle. They are closely related to mast cells and, like them, initiate the inflammatory response by releasing histamine. An increased basophil count (basophilia) accompanies eosinophilia in some species as part of the hypersensitivity reaction.  Monocytes are large cells with blue-gray cytoplasm, which may be vacuolated, and a kidney bean-shaped or lobulated nucleus. Their main function is phagocytosis, and they are essentially identical to tissue macrophages. An increased monocyte count (monocytosis) may occur in any chronic disease, especially chronic inflammation, and may be very marked in neoplasia. Monocytes also increase as part of the steroid response in dogs.  Lymphocytes mainly develop outside the bone marrow in the lymph nodes, spleen, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. They are the smallest of the WBCs, with a round, evenly staining nucleus and sparse cytoplasm. Larger, reactive lymphocytes can be seen after antigenic stimulation, and care must be taken to differentiate them from neoplastic lymphocytes. Their primary function is immunologic, including both antibody production and cell-mediated immune responses. Some survive only a few days, but many are long-lived. The number in circulation is a balance between populations in the blood, lymph, lymph nodes, and splenic follicles and does not necessarily reflect changes in lymphopoiesis. An increased lymphocyte count (lymphocytosis) may occur for physiologic reasons, especially in cats, but significant increases usually indicate leukemia. Immature or bizarre cells may also be recognized. Decreased lymphocyte counts (lymphopenia) are usually due to an effect of corticosteroids, either endogenous (stress or Cushing disease) or therapeutic, and may also accompany neutropenia in some viral infections, especially the parvoviruses. Lymphopenia may also be a feature of solid-organ lymphosarcomas, when leukemia is absent.  Platelets: Ecchymosis, abdomen, dog   Image Courtesy of Ontario Veterinary College.

Mammalian platelets are pale blue granular fragments (much smaller than RBCs) shed from multinucleate megakaryocytes in the bone marrow; avian and reptilian platelets are true cells with nuclei. They maintain the integrity of the endothelium and act as part of the clotting process to repair damaged endothelium, where they ensure mechanical strength of the clot.  Increased platelet counts (thrombocytosis) occur as a reaction to consumption after injury, when large juvenile platelets may also appear; after splenectomy, as splenic stores are liberated to the circulation; after vincristine treatment, which increases platelet shedding from megakaryocytes; and in megakaryocytic leukemia.  Decreased platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) are caused by autoimmune reactions, thrombotic/thrombocytopenic purpura, bone marrow suppression and aplasia, bone marrow neoplasia, and equine infectious anemia. Signs are petechiation and ecchymosis more than frank hemorrhage, and little may be seen until the platelet count is < 20 × 109/L. Platelet functional abnormalities present similarly, but platelet numbers and morphology are normal.  Blood Sample Preparation and Evaluation: In-house hematologic investigations, with a minimum of specialist equipment, can provide almost as much information as a full laboratory analysis, although some estimations are qualitative rather than quantitative.  Blood for hematology should be collected into tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant and immediately mixed well to avoid clotting. Larger (2.5 mL) tubes yield better results than the smaller (1 mL) pediatric tubes and are less likely to clot. Nevertheless, it is essential to fill the tube exactly to the mark, so smaller tubes may be unavoidable for small patients. WBC morphology deteriorates most quickly, especially in equine blood, so if the sample cannot be analyzed immediately, a thin blood smear should be submitted to the laboratory with the blood sample.  PCV is measured by microhematocrit, which is the reference method. A capillary tube is filled ¾ full with well-mixed blood and sealed at one end; heat-sealing is best if a Bunsen burner is available, otherwise a proprietary clay pad is used. The tube is spun in a high-speed microhematocrit centrifuge for 6 min, and the PCV is read using a microhematocrit reader with a sliding cursor. The appearance of the plasma (eg, normal, icteric, hemolyzed, lipemic) and the thickness of the buffy coat, which gives a very rough guide to total WBC count, should be noted.  Further information is obtained from a blood film. This is made by using one slide, with a corner broken off as a spreader, to pull a small drop of blood across a clean slide into a thin film. A suitable film is thin (one erythrocyte thick) and tapers to a feathered edge before the far end of the slide. The broken corner of the spreader slide ensures two straight edges parallel to the long edges of the slide. Immediately after the film is spread, it is dried quickly by fanning the slide in the air. Air-dried smears can be sent to the laboratory in a slide mailer or stained and examined in the practice. Commercial rapid Romanowsky-type stains merely require the slide to be dipped in three colored solutions in succession. Cell morphology is clear and comparable to more permanent stains such as Leishman or May-Gruenwald-Giemsa, although quality deteriorates after a few days. The slide should be allowed to dry naturally or dried with a hair dryer (not wiped dry), and examined under oil immersion.  Clinically useful information may be easily achieved in-house for all hematologic variables. The main deficiency is the absence of a numerical WBC count, and hence of numerical values for the differential WBC count. This may be acceptable for an interim emergency investigation, and a WBC count using a hemocytometer slide may be attempted. A mirrored slide with an Improved Neubauer ruling may be used, with a cover slip fitted so that Newton rings are visible on both sides. The blood sample is diluted 1:20 with Turck fluid or a similar diluent. An automatic pipette capable of dispensing 0.95 mL and 0.05 mL (50 μL) should be used to ensure an accurate dilution. The sample should be mixed well and allowed to stand for 10 min while the stain is taken up by the cells. The chamber of the hemocytometer is then filled by using a capillary (PCV) tube. The number of cells in each of the four large corner squares of the grid are counted, and the total divided by 20 to calculate the total WBC count × 10 9/L.  Several hematologic instruments are available for in-practice use. Those based on centrifugation, in which WBC measurements are made by spreading a stained buffy coat, are not true hematology analyzers, but give approximate counts. Although a numerical estimate of total WBC count is provided, the differential WBC count cannot distinguish between lymphocytes and monocytes, and results do not always correlate well with standard methods. This method is appropriate only as an emergency approximation, and a blood film must always be examined in addition. It is also wise to check the PCV by microhematocrit.  Impedance counters (Coulter principle) are used by diagnostic laboratories and perform well in experienced hands. However, it is difficult to achieve optimal performance without trained technical staff. Instruments not based on the Coulter principle should be avoided for veterinary use, because their results do not necessarily compare well on nonhuman samples. Instruments providing automated differential counts perform poorly on nonhuman blood, and results must never be accepted without also checking a blood film. No hematology laboratory should be without the facility for examining blood films, and a blood film should be examined for every patient sample. Quality assurance issues are the same as those for biochemistry laboratories ( see Clinical Biochemistry). If accuracy and reliability cannot be guaranteed to the same standard as the referral laboratory, then results should not be relied on without external confirmation.  Red Blood Cells: The size, uniformity of size, and presence of microcytes, macrocytes, and abnormally shaped cells should be noted, along with cell color, uniformity of color, and the presence of hypochromasia, polychromasia, and nucleated RBCs. An overall descriptive assessment of the RBC picture should be made, including the degree of regeneration or hypochromasia, if any.  White Blood Cells: A qualitative estimate of numbers should be made (ie, very low, low, normal, high, very high). This can be remarkably consistent with practice. The proportions of each cell type can be estimated, or preferably, a formal differential count of 100–200 cells performed. Unusual or abnormal WBC forms (eg, band or toxic neutrophils), or pathologic cells (eg, prolymphocytes, lymphoblasts, or mast cells) should be noted.  Platelets: A qualitative estimate of platelet numbers, based on how many can be seen in a typical high-power field (oil immersion) should be made. Several fields should be examined, more if numbers appear low. Results can be ranked as none seen (on entire slide), rare (very few on entire slide), low in number (< 5 per high-power field), adequate (5–20 per high-power field), or abundant (>20 per high-power field). Normal platelet numbers in the horse are about half those of other species. In a sample more than a few hours old, platelets may clump into rafts, leaving areas of the slide apparently devoid of platelets. Slides should be scanned for rafts before reporting platelet numbers as low. Enlarged or macroplatelets should also be noted. Urinalysis ByTrevor J.

It is useful to document various types of urinary tract diseases and may provide information about other systemic diseases, such as liver failure and hemolysis. Urine may be collected by cystocentesis, urethral catheterization, or voiding. Urine should be evaluated within 30 min, but if this is not possible, it may be refrigerated for up to 24 hr or submitted to an outside diagnostic laboratory; however, this may result in crystal precipitation. Refrigeration does not alter urine pH or specific gravity. If cytologic evaluation is required and a delay in preparing the slides is anticipated, then a preservative should be added. A few drops of 10% formalin (exact concentration not necessary) is better than boric acid. However, the usual Romanowsky stains are unsuitable with formalin; if submitting to an outside laboratory, it should be communicated that formalin has been added.  Urine Appearance Color: Normal urine is typically transparent and yellow or amber on visual inspection. The intensity of color is in part related to the volume of urine collected and concentration of urine produced; therefore, it should be interpreted in context of urine specific gravity. Significant disease may exist when urine color is normal. Abnormal urine color may be caused by presence of endogenous or exogenous pigments, but it does not provide specific information. Interpretation of semiquantitative reagent strips, which are colorimetric tests, requires knowledge of urine color because discolored urine may result in a false-positive result. Equine urine may turn brown after a period of time.  Clarity: Urine is typically clear but may become less transparent with pigmenturia, crystalluria, hematuria, pyuria, lipiduria, or when other compounds such as mucus are present. Depending on the cause, increased turbidity may disappear with centrifugation of the sample.  Odor: Normal urine has a slight odor of ammonia; however, the odor depends on urine concentration. Some species, such as cats and goats, have pungent urine odor because of urine composition. Bacterial infection may result in a strong odor due to pyuria; a strong ammonia odor may occur if the bacteria produce urease.  Urine Chemistries Urine must be at room temperature for accurate measurement of urine specific gravity and for chemical analysis. These tests are usually done before centrifugation; however, if urine is discolored or turbid, it may be beneficial to perform these tests on supernatant ( see Urine Sediment).  Specific Gravity: Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the weight of a volume of liquid to the weight of an equal volume of distilled water; therefore, it depends on the number, size, and weight of particles in the liquid. It is different from osmolality, which depends only on the number of particles in the liquid; measurement of osmolality requires specialized instrumentation.  The urine specific gravity (SG) is determined using a refractometer designed for veterinary samples, which includes a scale calibrated specifically for cat urine. SG for species other than cats should be determined using the scale for dogs. In healthy animals, SG is highly variable, depending on fluid and electrolyte balance of the body. It is normally at least 1.015. Interpretation of SG, therefore, depends on the clinical presentation and serum chemistry findings. ( See also heading on page Urinary System Introduction.) An animal that is dehydrated or has other causes of prerenal azotemia will have hypersthenuric urine with an SG >1.025–1.040 (depending on species). Dilute urine in a dehydrated or azotemic animal is abnormal and could be caused by renal failure, hypo- or hyperadrenocorticism, hypercalcemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, and diuretic therapy. In cases of diabetes insipidus, values < 1.010 can be expected. Glucosuria increases the SG despite increased urine volume.  Semiquantitative, Colorimetric Reagent Strips: Reagent strips such as Multistix® or Chemstrip ® can be used to perform several semiquantitative chemical evaluations simultaneously. They are used routinely to determine urine pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin/urobilinogen, and occult blood. Some reagent strips include test pads for leukocyte esterase (for detection of WBCs), nitrite (for detection of bacteria), and SG; these are not valid in animals and should not be used. Reagent strips are adversely affected by moisture and have a limited shelf life. Bottles should be kept tightly capped, and unused strips should be discarded after their expiration date.  Urine pH: Urine pH is typically acidic in dogs and cats and alkaline in horses and ruminants, but varies depending on diet, medications, or presence of disease. Reagent strip colorimetric test pads for pH determination are accurate to within ~0.5 pH units. For example, a reading of 6.5 means the actual pH is likely to be between 6.0 and 7.0. Portable pH meters are more accurate than pH colorimetric test pads. A bacterial urinary tract infection with a urease-producing microbe will result in alkaluria. Urine pH will affect crystalluria because some crystals, such as struvite, form in alkaline urine, whereas other crystals, such as cystine, form in acidic urine.  Protein: The protein test pad uses a color indicator (tetrabromophenol blue), which detects primarily albumin in urine. Results range from 10 mg/dL to 1,000 mg/dL. Proteinuria can occur from prerenal (fever, strenuous exercise, seizures, extreme environmental temperature, and hyperproteinemia), renal (primarily glomerular and occasionally tubular disease), or postrenal (inflammation, hemorrhage, and infection) causes. A positive reaction must be interpreted in light of SG, pH, and urine sediment examination. For example, a trace amount of protein in concentrated urine is less significant than a trace amount of protein in dilute urine. Alkaluria will give a false-positive reaction. Likewise, presence of other proteins, such as Bence-Jones proteins, will give false-negative results. Proteinuria can be measured using sulfosalicylic acid precipitation, which detects albumin and globulins; however, it is not accurate in dogs and cats. If proteinuria is present with an inactive urine sediment, its significance can be verified and quantitated by dividing the urine protein concentration by the urine creatinine concentration (urine protein to urine creatinine ratio [UP:UC]). Interpretation of a UP:UC is as follows: < 0.5:1 (dogs) and < 0.4:1 (cats) is normal, 0.4 or 0.5–1:1 is questionable, and >1:1 is abnormal. With primary renal azotemia, a UP:UC >0.5:1 in dogs and >0.4:1 in cats is considered abnormal. A semiquantitative microalbuminuria test is available to detect urinary albumin in the range of 1–30 mg/dL. It uses ELISA technology specific for canine or feline albumin. Because of minor species differences in albumin, there are different kits for dogs and cats. The microalbuminuria test detects lower concentrations of albumin than a standard dipstick test pad. Hematuria must be macroscopic to increase the microalbuminuria or UP:UC; however, pyuria increases both.  Glucose: Glucose is detected by a glucose oxidase enzymatic reaction that is specific for glucose. Glucosuria is not present normally because the renal threshold for glucose is >180 mg/dL in most species and >240 mg/dL in cats. With euglycemia, the amount of filtered glucose is less than the renal threshold, and all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules. Glucosuria can result from hyperglycemia (due to diabetes mellitus, excessive endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids, hepatocutaneous syndrome, or stress) or from a proximal renal tubular defect (such as primary renal glucosuria or Fanconi syndrome). If glucosuria is present, blood glucose concentration should be determined. False-negative results can occur with high urinary concentrations of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or with formaldehyde (a metabolite of the urinary antiseptic, methenamine, which may be used for prevention of bacterial urinary tract infections). False-positive results may occur if the sample is contaminated with hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, or hypochlorite (bleach).  Ketones: Ketones are produced from fatty acid metabolism and include acetoacetic acid, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate. The ketone test pad detects acetone and acetoacetic acid, but not β-hydroxybutyrate (which can be measured in blood and urine using a point-of-care instrument or a biochemistry analyzer). The test pad contains nitroprusside that reacts with acetoacetic acid and acetone to cause a purple color change; it is more sensitive to acetoacetic acid than acetone. Ketonuria is associated with primary ketosis (ruminants), ketosis secondary to diabetes mellitus (small animals), consumption of low-carbohydrate diets (especially in cats), and occasionally with prolonged fasting or starvation. A false-positive reaction can occur with presence of reducing substances in urine.  Bilirubin/Urobilinogen: When hemoglobin is degraded, the heme portion is converted to bilirubin, which is conjugated in the liver and excreted in bile. Some conjugated bilirubin is filtered by the glomerulus and excreted in urine. In dogs, but not cats, the kidney can metabolize hemoglobin to bilirubin and secrete it. Male dogs have a higher secretory ability than females. Dipstick reagent pads use diazonium salts to create a color change and are more sensitive to conjugated bilirubin than unconjugated bilirubin. Bilirubinuria occurs when conjugated bilirubin exceeds the renal threshold as with liver disease or hemolysis. In dogs with concentrated urine, a small amount of bilirubin can be normal. Pigmenturia and phenothiazine may result in a false-positive reaction; false-negative reactions may occur with large amounts of urinary ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Urobilinogen, formed from bilirubin by intestinal microflora, is absorbed into the portal circulation and excreted renally. A small amount of urinary urobilinogen is normal. Increased urinary urobilinogen occurs with hyperbilirubinemia; a negative test may be seen with biliary obstruction. However, the test is not specific enough to be clinically useful.  Occult Blood: The occult blood test pad uses a “pseudoperoxidase” method to detect intact RBCs, hemoglobin, and myoglobin. A positive reaction can be due to hemorrhage (hematuria), intravascular hemolysis (hemoglobinuria), or myoglobinuria. The latter two processes can be distinguished by examination of plasma: plasma will appear pink to red after intravascular hemolysis, whereas myoglobin is rapidly cleared from plasma, resulting in clear plasma. As with other colorimetric test pads, discolored urine may yield false-positive results. A positive result should be interpreted with microscopic examination of urine sediment.  Urine Sediment Microscopic examination of urine sediment should be part of a routine urinalysis. For centrifugation, 3–5 mL of urine is transferred to a conical centrifuge tube. Urine is centrifuged at 1,000–1,500 rpm for ~3–5 min. The supernatant is decanted, leaving ~0.5 mL of urine and sediment in the tip of the conical tube. The sediment is resuspended by tapping the tip of the conical tube against the table several times. A few drops of the sediment are transferred to a glass slide, and a cover slip is applied. Examination of unstained urine is recommended for routine samples. Microscopic examination is performed at 100× (for crystals, casts, and cells) and 400× (for cells and bacteria) magnifications. Contrast of the sample is enhanced by closing the iris diaphragm and lowering the condenser of the microscope. Stains such as Sedistain® and new methylene blue can be used to aid in cell identification but may dilute the specimen and introduce artifacts such as stain precipitate and crystals. Use of a modified Wright stain increases the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detection of bacteria. For some tests, air dried, stained smears are necessary.  Red Blood Cells: In an unstained preparation, RBCs are small and round and have a slight orange tint and a smooth appearance. Normal urine should contain < 5 RBCs/field at 400× magnification. Increased RBCs in urine (hematuria) indicates hemorrhage somewhere in the urogenital system; however, sample collection by cystocentesis or catheterization may induce hemorrhage.  White Blood Cells: WBCs are slightly larger than RBCs and have grainy cytoplasm. Normal urine should contain < 5 WBCs/field at 400× magnification. Increased WBCs (pyuria) can occur due to inflammation, infection, trauma, or neoplasia. Catheterization or collection of voided urine may introduce a few WBCs from the urogenital tract.  Epithelial Cells: Transitional epithelial cells, a common urine contaminant derived from the bladder and proximal urethra, resemble WBCs but are larger. They have a greater amount of grainy cytoplasm and a round, centrally located nucleus. In a voided urine sample, squamous epithelial cells may be seen. They are large, oval to cuboidal in shape, and may or may not contain a nucleus. Occasionally, neoplastic transitional cells may be seen in an animal with a transitional cell carcinoma. Neoplastic squamous cells may be seen in an animal with a squamous cell carcinoma.  Cylindruria (Casts): Casts are elongated, cylindrical structures formed by mucoprotein congealing within renal tubules and may contain cells. Hyaline casts are pure protein precipitates; they are transparent, have parallel sides and rounded ends, and are composed of mucoprotein. They may occur with fever, exercise, and renal disease. Epithelial cellular casts form from entrapment of sloughed tubular epithelial cells in the mucoprotein; they may be seen with renal tubular disease. Granular casts are thought to represent degenerated epithelial cellular casts. Waxy casts have a granular appearance and are thought to arise from degeneration of longstanding granular casts. They typically have sharp borders with broken ends. Other cellular casts include RBC casts and WBC casts and are always abnormal. RBC casts form because of renal hemorrhage. WBC casts form because of renal inflammation, as with pyelonephritis. Fatty casts are not common but can be seen with disorders of lipid metabolism, such as diabetes mellitus. A few hyaline or granular casts are considered normal. However, presence of cellular casts or other casts in high numbers indicates renal damage, and may be one of the earliest laboratory abnormalities noted with toxic damage to renal epithelial cells (eg, gentamicin, amphotericin B).  Infectious Organisms: The presence of bacteria in urine collected by cystocentesis indicates infection. Small numbers of bacteria from the lower urogenital tract may contaminate voided samples or samples collected by catheterization and do not indicate infection. Bacterial rods are most easily identified in urine sediment. Particles of debris may be mistaken for bacteria. Suspected bacteria can be confirmed by staining urine sediment with Gram stain; however, aerobic culture is best to confirm a bacterial urinary tract infection. Rarely, yeast and fungal hyphae and parasitic ova may be seen in urine sediment. Their presence is not always associated with clinical disease. Parasitic ova observed include those of Stephanurus dentatus, Capillaria plica, C felis, and Dioctophyma renale. Additionally, microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis may be seen in urine sediment.  Crystals: Many urine sediments contain crystals. The type of crystal present depends on urine pH, concentration of crystallogenic materials, urine temperature, and length of time between urine collection and examination. Crystalluria is not synonymous with urolithiasis and is not necessarily pathologic. Furthermore, uroliths may form without observed crystalluria. Many urine samples are examined at room temperature, which may alter the number of crystals present, and the result may not represent the situation in vivo.  Struvite crystals are commonly seen in canine and feline urine. Struvite crystalluria in dogs is not a problem unless there is a concurrent bacterial urinary tract infection with a urease-producing microbe. Without an infection, struvite crystals in dogs are not associated with struvite urolith formation. However, some animals (eg, cats) do form struvite uroliths without a bacterial urinary tract infection. In these animals, struvite crystalluria may be pathologic. Struvite crystals appear typically as “coffin-lids” or “prisms”; however, they may be amorphous.  Calcium oxalate crystalluria occurs less commonly in dogs and cats. If persistent, it may indicate an increased risk of calcium oxalate urolith formation, which has been increasing in some countries throughout the past few years. ( See also page Urolithiasis in Horses and feline interstitial cystitis.) However, calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate crystalluria is common in healthy horses and cattle. Calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals appear as squares with an “X” in the middle, or “envelope-shaped.” Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are “dumb-bell” shaped. An unusual form of calcium oxalate crystals is typically seen in association with ethylene glycol toxicity ( see Ethylene Glycol Toxicosis). These crystals are found in neutral to acidic urine. They are small, flat, and colorless and are shaped like “picket fence posts.”  Ammonium acid urate crystals suggest liver disease (eg, portosystemic shunt). These crystals occur in acidic urine and are yellow-brown spheres with irregular, spiny projections; however, they may also be amorphous. Certain species, such as birds and reptiles, and certain breeds of dogs, specifically Dalmatians, can normally have ammonium acid urate crystalluria.  Cystine crystals are six-sided and of variable size. They are seen in acidic urine. Presence of cystine crystals represents a proximal tubular defect in amino acid reabsorption. Cystinuria has been reported in many breeds of dogs and rarely in cats. Dachshunds, Newfoundlands, English Bulldogs, and Scottish Terriers have a high incidence of cystine urolithiasis.  Bilirubin crystals occur with bilirubinuria; however, they may be normal in small numbers in dogs.  Lipids: Fat droplets are commonly present in urine from dogs and cats and may be mistaken for RBCs. They often vary in size and tend to float on a different plane of focus than the remainder of the sediment. They are not considered to be pathologic.  Spermatozoa: Spermatozoa may be seen normally in urine collected from reproductively intact male dogs.  Plant Material: Occasionally, plant material may be seen in urine samples collected by voiding. When present, they indicate contamination of the urine sample and are not pathologic.  Bladder Tumor Antigen Test The bladder tumor antigen test can be used to screen for transitional cell carcinoma in dogs. The results are not specific for transitional cell carcinoma, and non-neoplastic disease (eg, urinary tract infections, hematuria, etc) can give positive results. A negative test, however, is meaningful in that a transitional cell carcinoma is not likely to be present. This test may be useful for routine screening of dogs at higher risk of developing transitional cell carcinoma (eg, Scottish terriers) that do not have other signs or laboratory findings of lower urinary tract disease. This tests for the presence of basement membrane fragments and is a color reaction using a commercial test kit. Serologic Test Kits ByTrevor J.

They include tests for infectious disease by measuring either antigens or antibodies. Antibody levels can also be measured to establish the presence of adequate protection to an infectious agent. However, these levels are not an absolute measure of protection. High serum antibody levels do not always confer protection, and low levels do not always indicate susceptibility to infection. The level of cell-mediated immunity is also important. Measurement of hormone levels also use serologic tests. Many of these tests are ELISA that may be microwell or membrane-based, but other types, including immunomigration, immunochromatography, and agglutination tests, are also available. Sample requirements may be plasma, serum, whole blood, feces, or saliva, depending on the test format.  Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV): Serologic testing for FeLV is important to identify infected cats and prevent transmission of the virus ( see Feline Leukemia Virus). Testing is also recommended before vaccination against FeLV, because vaccination of infected cats will not limit development or transmission of disease. Most currently available in-house diagnostic kits are designed to detect soluble FeLV-specific gag protein p 27, which is produced in large amounts during viremia. The time between infection and the presence of detectable antigen varies but is likely to be within 28–30 days. Vaccination against FeLV will not yield a positive test result when antigen tests are used, nor will the presence of maternally derived antibodies in kittens. Testing serum, plasma, or whole blood is considered more reliable than testing saliva or tears. Most test kits have positive and negative controls incorporated into the kit, so technical problems with running the test may be detected.  A negative result on a screening test is very reliable; however, false-positive results may occur with the tests of soluble antigen, especially in a population of cats with a low incidence of disease. A true positive result may reflect either transient or persistent viremia, so clinical decisions should not be based on a single test result. Confirmation of positive results, especially in asymptomatic cats, should be pursued by additional testing such as soluble antigen testing using a kit from a different manufacturer or immunofluorescent antigen testing on blood or bone marrow. Cats with discordant results should be retested using both test methods in 60 days and should probably be considered potentially infective until their status is clarified.  Some cats previously thought to have cleared infection have been identified using real-time PCR, which is a very sensitive method to detect cell-associated FeLV proviral DNA or viral RNA. These cats are proviral DNA positive but FeLV antigen negative and are unlikely to shed virus or develop clinical disease. However, proviral FeLV could be transmitted in blood transfusions, so potential feline blood donors should be PCR negative for FeLV.  Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV): Because the concentration of FIV antigen in the blood of infected cats is often very low, in-house diagnostic tests are designed to detect anti-FIV antibodies rather than antigen. Test kits yield a positive or negative result for antibody rather than a titer. Antibodies usually develop within 60 days of infection, but this period is quite variable, and a few infected cats do not develop detectable antibody levels. Once present, antibodies appear to be present for >2 yr, except for those transiently detectable in kittens that have maternally derived antibodies. A kitten < 6 mo of age that tests positive should be retested after 6 mo of age for this reason. If the test is still positive, the kitten is most likely infected.  With the currently available ELISA in-house test kits, sensitivity is high. However, these tests cannot distinguish between antibodies produced in response to vaccination with FIV vaccine and those produced by natural infection. An ELISA test that appears to successfully discriminate between antibodies produced in response to vaccination and those produced in natural infections has been developed but is not available for commercial use. A reasonable approach is to use the in-house test as a screening test. A negative result is a fairly reliable indicator that the cat is not infected. Positive results, especially in asymptomatic cats, should be confirmed by another test such as Western blot if available. Kittens born to vaccinated queens are antibody-positive for a variable length of time.  Canine Parvovirus (CPV): Both ELISA and immunomigration test kits are available for detection of CPV antigen in feces. These tests are fairly specific for the virus, but dogs that have been recently vaccinated may transiently shed antigens detected by the test kits. The sensitivity is somewhat lower for several reasons. Fecal shedding occurs for only ~7–10 days, beginning on day 3–5 after exposure, so virus is not always detectable in dogs with clinical signs. Blood in the feces as well as the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, with antibodies from the blood or exudate present in the gut, may be associated with false-negative results. It appears that in-house test kits may have decreased sensitivity to the new CPV2c strain.  Although in-house test kits for diagnosis of CPV are not licensed for use in cats, several studies have shown they can be used to detect feline panleukopenia virus in cat feces. The specificity and sensitivity are not known. Some cats test positive after vaccination, even when inactivated virus vaccines are used.  In-house tests for assay of anti-CPV antibodies have become available to evaluate the need for revaccination and the presence of possibly interfering maternal antibodies. These tests are not intended to diagnose parvovirus infection and do not distinguish between natural exposure and vaccine-induced antibodies. Currently available test kits include ELISA and immunochromatographic tests. They are semiquantitative and use color changes in positive control wells compared with color changes in samples to determine relative antibody levels. The level of anti-CPV antibody protective against infection is not known, but results are interpreted based on protective titers measured by other methods. PCR is widely available for detection of virus in feces.  Canine Distemper Virus (CDV): In-house test kits for determination of antibodies to CDV are available, usually in combination with canine parvovirus antibody testing. These tests are semiquantitative ELISA for anti-canine distemper IgG in serum or plasma. They may be used to evaluate the need for revaccination and to determine the level of maternal antibody present in puppies. They are less useful for diagnosis of infection with CDV. An immunochromatography-based assay for CDV antigen has been developed and has good sensitivity and specificity, especially when conjunctival swabs are the sample used; sensitivity and specificity are somewhat less for blood and nasal swabs. This assay is not currently available as an in-house test kit.  Borrelia burgdorferi: Lyme disease ( see Lyme Borreliosis) is caused by the tickborne spirochete B burgdorferi. In general, diagnostic tests for this infection have had several potential problems, including relatively high levels of positive results in clinically healthy animals, persistence of antibodies after apparent resolution of clinical disease, interpretation of antibody titers in vaccinated dogs, and the fact that detectable antibody may not be present until 4–6 wk after exposure. An in-clinic ELISA test kit for detection of anti–B burgdorferi antibodies in serum or plasma minimizes some of these problems by using a synthetic peptide (C6) based on a conserved B burgdorferi–specific protein. This protein is important in inducing a humoral immune response by 3–5 wk after natural infection in dogs. Vaccination does not induce a cross-reactive immune response to this antigen, so assays using the C6 protein are able to distinguish vaccine-induced antibodies from those produced in response to natural infections. C6-based assays are also more specific than previous tests, because there is no cross-reactivity with other tickborne agents or with autoimmune antibodies.  A currently available in-house test assay for anti–B burgdorferi antibodies is a screening test that gives only a positive or negative result and is thus not quantitative. Although licensed for dogs, this test kit also has been validated in cats and horses. Quantitative assays, performed in reference laboratories, can be used to monitor treatment efficacy (ie, detection of decreasing antibody titers), but these results are not always conclusive.  Ehrlichia canis: Canine ehrlichiosis ( see Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Related Infections in Animals) is a tickborne disease caused by one of several species of Ehrlichia. It can be associated with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia as well as other nonspecific clinical signs. Although identification of Ehrlichia morulae in leukocytes can be diagnostic for this infection, serologic assay for detection of antibodies is more common and has better sensitivity. In-house tests for ehrlichiosis are either qualitative (giving only a positive or negative result) or semiquantitative tests for antibodies to E canis. Those currently available are ELISA to be performed on serum, plasma, or whole blood. The test kits use either recombinant analogues of major outer membrane proteins of E canis or whole E canis proteins as the antigen. The different Ehrlichia species stimulate antibodies that appear to cross-react in these assays, for the most part. Because anti−E canis antibodies may be very long-lived and may be present in subclinical infections, detection of these antibodies does not distinguish between exposure and Ehrlichia-induced illness and cannot reliably indicate success of response to therapy.  Brucella canis: B canis is not a problem in some countries, and tests are not always readily available. However, infection may be subclinical, or it may cause a variety of clinical signs, including abortion, infertility, and discospondylitis ( see Brucellosis in Dogs). Infection most often occurs during mating; thus, testing of breeding animals is important in disease prevention. A rapid slide agglutination test that includes a 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) step to reduce false-positive results by eliminating nonspecific IgM reactions is available as an in-house diagnostic kit. This assay detects serum antibody to surface antigens of the bacteria. Reports of sensitivity and specificity of this test vary depending on the confirmatory test used. ELISA and immunochromatographic assays have been developed for qualitative and semiquantitative tests for anti–B canis antibodies. Positive results obtained using any of these test kits should be confirmed with PCR or blood culture.  Heartworm Antigen—Dogs: Serologic testing for heartworm antigen in dogs is more sensitive than screening for microfilaremia and, in addition, can detect occult infections. Heartworm antigen is first detectable at ~5 mo after infection and will usually precede microfilaremia by a few weeks; however, this time frame may be shifted later in animals on macrocyclic lactone preventives and those with low numbers of worms. Antigen test formats available include ELISA and immunochromatographic assays. Serum or plasma may be used in all kits, and some may be performed using whole blood. Some test kits can be stored at room temperature, whereas others must be stored refrigerated and brought to room temperature before use. Batch testing and single sample testing are both available. All of the test kits have very high specificity. False-positive results are most often due to technical problems such as inadequate washing or failure to read the results at the optimal time. Manufacturer’s instructions should be closely followed with any of the test formats.  Sensitivity varies from one test to another and is affected by worm load, worm gender (a female antigen is detected, thus male-only infections will not be detected), and maturity of female worms. None of these tests has 100% sensitivity. When unexpected false results are obtained on an antigen test, additional testing, using a different format, is recommended.  After adulticide treatment, antigenemia should become undetectable by 6 mo. However, it can take more than a month for some adult heartworms to die, so a positive antigen test at 5–6 mo after treatment does not necessarily indicate treatment failure. The test should be repeated 2–3 mo later.  Heartworm Antibody and Antigen—Cats: Heartworm disease in cats is substantially different from the disease in dogs, and recommendations for serologic testing are consequently different. Cats tend to have a much lower worm burden—often only one or two worms. Cats also have single-sex infections more frequently than do dogs. Circulating microfilaremia is rare in cats, and microfilariae have a shorter life span. These differences are often attributed to a more effective feline immune response to heartworm infection. However, heartworms can cause serious disease in cats.  Heartworm antigen tests are less sensitive for detection of infection in cats than they are in dogs, with a reported sensitivity of 50%–80%. Therefore, a negative antigen test does not exclude heartworm infection. Antibody testing is also available and can be useful as a screening test, but the presence of antibody does not confirm feline heartworm disease. Transient exposure to larvae will stimulate production of antibody; many early infections are cleared spontaneously, and adult heartworms never develop. A combination of testing for both heartworm antigen and anti-heartworm antibody results in much higher sensitivity and specificity than using either test method alone. Combination testing is warranted in cats with clinical signs of heartworm disease when results of a single test are not conclusive.  Test kits for detection of heartworm antigen and anti-heartworm antibody in cats are marketed in several formats. These can use either plasma or serum and are qualitative or semiquantitative.  Canine and Feline Pregnancy Diagnosis—Relaxin: The only known pregnancy-specific hormone in the bitch and queen is relaxin, which is produced by the placenta when a fertilized egg is implanted. Relaxin is first detectable in the plasma around day 20–25 after fertilization. It is not present in pseudopregnant or nonpregnant bitches or queens. Relaxin levels peak by approximately day 40–50 of gestation and drop at parturition, but they may remain detectable for up to 50 days during lactation. In-clinic test kits to measure relaxin include microwell ELISA and immunomigration qualitative tests requiring serum, plasma, or whole blood. The assays appear to have very good specificity, ie, a detectable level of relaxin is not found in nonpregnant animals. False-negative results have been reported in some bitches carrying very small litters or in those with one or more nonviable puppies.  Canine and Feline Luteinizing Hormone—Ovulation Timing and Ovariectomy Status: In the bitch, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) is normally present in very low levels except for a dramatic rise just before ovulation. Ovulation occurs 2 days after this LH surge, and the LH level returns to baseline within 24–40 hr of peaking. Serum progesterone levels begin to rise at the time of the LH surge. A bitch will be fertile between 4–7 days after the LH surge, with the most fertile period on days 5 and 6. In addition, the LH surge determines the gestation period, with parturition occurring between day 64 and 66 after the surge. The LH surge may occur anywhere from 3 days before to 5 days after the onset of estrous behavior, so it cannot be reliably predicted by behavior.  Ovulation timing by measurement of LH requires daily testing, which usually begins when >50% of vaginal epithelial cells are cornified, based on vaginal cytology. There is occasionally a false LH peak not followed by ovulation, but it will also not be followed by an increase in progesterone. For that reason, assays of both LH and progesterone are recommended for most accurate ovulation detection. An increased LH concentration not followed by increased progesterone levels is considered a proestrus fluctuation, and testing for ovulation should continue.  A currently available in-clinic kit to measure LH concentrations in serum is essentially qualitative, with a serum level of < 1 ng/mL being read as negative and a level of >1 ng/mL considered positive. The test is an immunochromatographic assay.  Ovariectomized bitches and queens have serum concentrations of LH >1 ng/mL. Because this LH concentration is also seen in intact bitches about to ovulate, a single high LH concentration does not confirm reproductive status, but a low LH concentration indicates a nonovariectomized animal.  Canine Ovulation Timing—Progesterone: Serum progesterone begins to increase after the LH surge with a modest increase on the day before ovulation and a further increase to 4–10 ng/mL on the day of ovulation. Progesterone continues to increase and stays increased throughout pregnancy or diestrus. As the rise in progesterone is more constant compared with LH, daily testing is not necessary. It is recommended that testing begin in late proestrus and continue every 2–3 days until a high range is reached, indicating ovulation.  The test kits for in-clinic progesterone testing are semiquantitative ELISA with preovulatory concentrations designated according to the kit used. Some kits are designed to give two additional progesterone ranges (intermediate and high), whereas others indicate only preovulatory and “ovulatory day or later” levels. In comparison with other test methods, the in-house test kits are less accurate, particularly in the range of roughly 1.5–10 ng/mL, which is the range of interest for earliest detection of ovulation. Accuracy is greater at higher progesterone levels. As mentioned above, measurement of both LH and progesterone is recommended for most accurate breeding management.  Thyroxine: Assay of total serum thyroxine (T4) may be used as a screening test for canine hypothyroidism or as a diagnostic test for feline hyperthyroidism. (Also see The Thyroid Gland.) In addition, T4 concentrations are measured when monitoring therapy for hypo- or hyperthyroidism. An in-house ELISA test kit, which uses an additional instrument to read results, provides semiquantitative information about T4 concentration in canine and feline sera. The assay is run at one of two “dynamic ranges,” depending on the predicted range of results. Published studies comparing this assay with other test methods for T4 vary in their conclusions. It is recommended that T4 concentrations be periodically measured in stored pooled serum of cats and dogs to monitor whether assay performance is consistent. It is probably still better to use a commercial laboratory for thyroxine measurement.  Almost all (99%) of total T4 is bound to protein in the blood and therefore not biologically accurate. Free T4 levels are a more accurate test of thyroid function in cats and dogs.  Foal Immunoglobulin (IgG): Measurement of foal serum IgG concentration within the first 24 hr after birth can be useful in preventing disease related to failure of passive transfer of IgG in colostrum from mare to foal. Use of foal-side testing procedures can facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. A foal serum IgG level of >800 mg/dL is generally considered optimal, with < 200 mg/dL indicating failure of passive transfer. Concentrations of 200–800 mg/dL are considered evidence of partial transfer.  Although radial immunodiffusion is considered the most accurate test for IgG concentration, it takes much longer (5–24 hr) than many of the other test methods and thus is not as useful as an indicator of the need for therapeutic intervention. More rapid screening tests include the zinc sulfate turbidity test, glutaraldehyde clot test, and ELISA test kits.  The zinc sulfate test estimates IgG in serum based on its precipitation when added to a zinc-containing solution. Turbidity generally becomes visible when IgG levels are 400–500 mg/dL. This test takes ~1 hr and may be performed with zinc sulfate solutions made in the clinic, or reagents for the test may be purchased as a test kit.  The glutaraldehyde clot test requires the addition of 1 volume of serum to 10 volumes of 10% glutaraldehyde and examination of the tubes at timed intervals up to 60 min. The presence of IgG in the serum causes a solid clot to form in the tube. Clot formation in < 10 min generally correlates to an IgG concentration of >800 mg/dL, whereas a positive reaction within 60 min is interpreted as an IgG concentration of >400 mg/dL. Both of these test methods use serum, rather than plasma, so time for the blood to clot and separation of serum must be added to the time needed to perform the test.  ELISA test kits for in-house or foal-side testing can use either serum or whole blood as the sample and take ~10 min. Most are semiquantitative, with color changes corresponding to IgG concentrations of < 400 mg/dL, 400–800 mg/dL, or >800 mg/dL. One quantitative handheld colorimetric immunoassay is currently available.  Reports of sensitivity and specificity among these methods vary. In general, sensitivity in identifying foals with IgG concentrations < 400 mg/dL appears to be acceptable for all methods. Thus, there are few foals with total failure of passive transfer that would not be identified by any of these methods. Specificity is less acceptable for some of the methods, and treatment of some foals that did not need it might be instituted based on the results.  Calf Immunoglobulin: Measurement of IgG concentration in neonatal calf serum is important for the same reasons described for foals. However, IgG levels in calves are different from those in foals, with >1,000 mg/dL considered evidence of adequate passive transfer and < 1,000 mg/dL indicating failure of passive transfer. Radial immunodiffusion is the gold standard for accurate measurement of serum IgG in calves (as in foals), but the length of time required to complete this assay makes it less useful than other methods. Other methods include zinc sulfate and sodium sulfite turbidity tests, glutaraldehyde coagulation test, measurement of total serum solids by refractometry, and a lateral flowthrough ELISA test kit.  The sodium sulfite and zinc sulfate turbidity tests are both based on the precipitation of high-molecular-weight proteins in these solutions. Serum is used as the sample, and tests are read after 15–30 min of incubation. Results of these tests vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the endpoint chosen, and technical difficulties with reagents can decrease test performance. The glutaraldehyde clot test is performed as in foals, with no clot formation at 60 min indicating failure of passive transfer.  Measurement of serum total protein by refractometer is a fairly reliable indicator of adequate passive transfer in healthy, well-hydrated calves. A level of 5.2 g/dL is roughly equivalent to an IgG concentration of 1,000 mg/dL.  A commercially available ELISA test kit uses serum as the sample and takes ~20 min. The assay is qualitative in that it indicates an IgG concentration of >1,000 mg/dL or < 1,000 mg/dL. Sensitivity and specificity are reasonably good, and this test is less influenced by factors such as calf dehydration or reagent instability than some other methods. Manufacturer recommendations for storing and using the kits must be followed. Parasitology in Veterinary Practice ByGary Conboy, DVM, PhD, DACVM-Parasit, Atlantic Veterinary College, Department of Pathology and Microbiology Reviewed ByAngel Abuelo, DVM, PhD, DABVP, DECBHM, FHEA, MRCVS, Michigan State University, College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed/Revised May 2025 Internal Parasite (Endoparasite) Diagnosis in Small Animals | Internal Parasite (Endoparasite) Diagnosis in Horses and Production Animals | External Parasite (Ectoparasite) Examination in Small Animals and Production Animals | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (7) Tables (0) Videos (0) Internal Parasite (Endoparasite) Diagnosis in Small Animals Antemortem diagnosis of endoparasitic infections in small animals usually results from the detection of immature stages of the parasites that can be present in feces, urine, saliva-sputum, or blood.   Fecal examination makes up a large part of laboratory diagnostic testing for parasitic infection. Detection of a wide range of endoparasites infecting small animals is possible through the use of various fecal examination techniques.   Fecal examination techniques are noninvasive and relatively inexpensive, making them among the most cost-effective diagnostic tests available. Fecal samples should be as fresh as possible.  Dog owners should be instructed to submit only samples collected immediately after deposit (to be certain the sample came from their own dog).  Cat owners should clean the litter box and then collect the next available sample.  Samples should be collected in leakproof, sealable plastic containers. If samples cannot be submitted within 2 hours of collection, they should be refrigerated at 4°C.   Samples exposed to soil or grass for extended lengths of time are unsuitable because they could have been invaded by free-living nematodes.   Samples incubated at room temperature for > 6 hours are unsuitable because it takes < 6 hours for helminth eggs to develop and hatch and for protozoal trophozoites or cysts to degrade.   Immature parasite stages can be sporadically shed in the feces of an infected animal. Therefore, for animals showing clinical signs that suggest parasitic infection, a single negative fecal examination result is insufficient to rule out parasitism.   To rule out parasitism, examinations should be conducted on three samples collected either on consecutive days or over 7–10 days.  Pearls & Pitfalls  To rule out parasitism, examinations should be conducted on three samples collected either on consecutive days or over 7–10 days.  False-positive results are possible with all of the fecal examination methods because of coprophagia (dogs) and hunting (cats, dogs).  A dog that ingests feces containing helminth eggs, protozoal cysts, or nematode larvae from an infected animal will shed those parasites in its feces over the next several days.  A cat or dog that hunts will shed in its feces the immature stages of any parasite that is in a prey animal it eats for several days after feeding on that animal.  Examination of Feces for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals The most widely used fecal examination methods are simple flotation and centrifugal flotation. Other methods include direct smear, simple sedimentation, Baermann examination, and ELISA. Each of these additional methods is preferred for certain indications, as detailed below.  Simple Fecal Flotation Simple flotation is often done with commercial kits (see simple fecal flotation kit image), in which a small amount of feces is mixed with a high-specific-gravity (1.18–1.33) salt or sugar flotation solution in a chamber. The specific instructions for the commercial kit should be followed. In general, the instructions for these kits are a variation of the following:  A small amount of feces is placed in the bottom of the chamber.  The chamber is half filled with flotation medium.  The insert is placed in the chamber and rotated back and forth one-quarter turn for 20–30 seconds to mix the feces with the flotation medium.  The insert is firmly snapped into place in the chamber.  The chamber is completely filled with flotation medium to form a positive meniscus.  A coverslip or slide is added on top.  The sample is allowed to sit for 5–10 minutes. The parasite stages are concentrated as they float up to the surface of the flotation medium and attach to the slide or coverslip.  The coverslip is then placed on a glass slide and examined under the microscope using the 10X objective to identify the parasites.  Simple fecal flotation kit   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal Fecal Flotation Detection sensitivity of fecal flotation is greatly improved if centrifugation is added (see centrifuge image). In general, centrifugal flotation is far superior to simple flotation for detecting parasites. The most dramatic example is the detection of the bipolar-plugged eggs of whipworms or capillarids.  Pearls & Pitfalls  In general, centrifugal flotation is far superior to simple flotation for detecting parasites.  Fecal flotation tubes in centrifuge   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal flotation is conducted as follows:  Approximately 1 teaspoon of feces (3–5 g) is mixed in flotation medium, sieved through cheesecloth or a tea strainer, poured into a test tube, and centrifuged at 650 g for 10 minutes.  Flotation medium is then added to completely fill the test tube (forming a positive meniscus),  A coverslip is added, and the sample is allowed to sit for 5–20 minutes.  The coverslip is placed on a microscope slide, and the entire area under the coverslip is systematically examined, using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  Most helminth eggs and protozoal cysts are detected by centrifugal flotation (see dog sample and sheep sample images). Protozoal trophozoites, nematode larvae, spirurid eggs, acanthocephalan eggs, and operculate eggs (trematodes, Diphyllobothrium spp, Spirometra mansonoides) are not reliably detected by flotation methods.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Protozoal trophozoites, nematode larvae, spirurid eggs, acanthocephalan eggs, and operculate eggs are not reliably detected by flotation methods.  Centrifugal fecal flotation sample, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal fecal flotation sample, sheep   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Various flotation media are available for use. Sugar flotation medium has the advantage of not crystallizing as readily as salt solutions do; therefore, slides prepared with sugar medium can be stored for a few days in the refrigerator if there is a need to reexamine the slide or consult with a colleague.  For use in small animal diagnostics, centrifugal flotation using zinc sulfate (ZnSO4; specific gravity 1.18) is considered the best option for detecting Giardia duodenalis cysts.  Direct Smear The simplest and most inexpensive fecal examination test is the direct smear. A tiny speck of feces (on the end of an applicator stick) is mixed in a drop of saline solution on a microscope slide, and the slide is examined under a microscope. Care must be taken not to mix in too much fecal matter (print should be easily visible through the preparation if placed on a book). Turning down (partially closing) the condenser on the microscope helps decrease brightness and increases contrast, typically making it easier to see unstained parasite ova or trophozoites.  Direct smear is the method of choice for detecting protozoal trophozoites such as G duodenalis and Tritrichomonas blagburni. When these parasites are suspected, direct smears should be done on very fresh feces (within 20 minutes of deposit) because the trophozoites die and become unrecognizable very quickly after feces are passed by an infected animal.  All of the parasites listed above that are not reliably detected by centrifugal flotation can be diagnosed by direct smear; however, false-negative results are common because such a small amount of feces is examined.  Simple Sedimentation Simple sedimentation is the method of choice for detecting operculate eggs. The test is simple to set up but relatively time-consuming to perform:  A small amount of fecal matter (1–2 g) is mixed with water and passed through a coarse sieve (cheesecloth or tea strainer).  The fecal-water solution is poured into a test tube and left to stand upright in a rack for 5 minutes.  The supernatant is poured off, the tube is refilled with clean water, the sediment is resuspended by stirring with an applicator, and the tube is left to stand for another 5 minutes.  This sequence is repeated a third time, during which the supernatant is poured off and the small amount of remaining fluid and sediment are examined microscopically (several drops placed on a slide with a coverslip added).  Because of the time required to examine a sedimentation sample, this test should be reserved for cases in which an animal has clinical signs that suggest infection with a parasite that has eggs not reliably detected by centrifugal flotation.  Simple sedimentation is the method of choice for the operculate eggs of trematodes (Alaria spp, Cryptocotyle lingua, Nanophyetus salmincola, Paragonimus kellicotti, Platynosomum illiciens) and pseudophyllidean cestodes (Diphyllobothrium spp, S mansonoides).  When infection by the blood fluke Heterobilharzia americana is suspected, saline solution must be used instead of water for the sedimentation procedure. Water induces the eggs to hatch and release the ciliated miracidia, which would be lost with the supernatant, giving false-negative test results.  Simple sedimentation is also recommended for detecting the eggs of spirurid worms (Physaloptera spp) or acanthocephalans (eg, Onicola canis), neither of which are reliably detected by flotation methods.  Baermann Examination Baermann examination is the method of choice for detecting nematode larvae (ie, lungworms and Strongyloides stercoralis). The test is simple to set up; however, accurate identification of nematode larvae tends to be challenging.  Extra care must be taken to ensure that the client has collected only fresh samples (ie, fecal matter collected and submitted within 2 hours of deposit or refrigerated immediately after collection and stored for no longer than 2–3 days before submission). In addition, the shedding of larvae in feces tends to be sporadic in animals infected with lungworms, increasing the chances of a false-negative result. Therefore, three Baermann examinations of samples collected on 3 consecutive days or every 2–3 days might be necessary to detect infections.  Baermann examination requires a glass funnel with tubing attached, a clamp, a funnel rack, cheesecloth, and hot tap water (see Baermann examination setup image):  With the clamp securely in place and closing off the tubing, the funnel is half-filled with hot tap water (not too hot to touch without gloves).  Approximately 10–20 g of fresh feces is placed in a double layer of cheesecloth, and an applicator stick is pushed through the cheesecloth corners to form a sling around the fecal sample.  The cheesecloth-wrapped sample is placed in the water and left to sit for at least 8 hours.  With care taken not to spill any of the first drops, the clamp is gently released, and the fluid is caught in a 15-mL test tube.  The tube is centrifuged (650 g, 10 minutes), the supernatant is discarded, and the few remaining drops and sediment are examined by placing a drop on a microscope slide and adding a coverslip.  Baermann examination setup   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Nematode larvae are usually fairly active, moving vigorously, so they are relatively easy to see under the microscope's 10X objective. Once detected, the larvae should be killed to examine them in detail for accurate identification. The larvae might be killed simply by placing a drop of dilute iodine (approximately the color of tea) at the edge of the coverslip and allowing it to wick across the parasites under the coverslip.  Baermann examination is the method of choice for detecting intestinal infections caused by S stercoralis (in dogs) and cardiorespiratory infections caused by Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (in cats), Angiostrongylus vasorum (in dogs), and Crenosoma vulpis (in dogs).  Baermann examination is not the method of choice for identifying infections caused by Filaroides hirthi or Oslerus osleri in dogs. The larvae of these two pathogens lack the vigor and motility necessary to swim from the fecal sample out into warm water; therefore, they are not reliably detected by Baermann examination.  For F hirthi and O osleri in dogs, microscopic examination of saliva, sputum, or samples from transtracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage is recommended instead. Bronchoscopy also can be used to identify the large wartlike nodules of O osleri at the bifurcation of the trachea.  Immunological Tests A commercially available fecal ELISA can be used to test for G duodenalis infection in dogs and cats. It is accurate and more sensitive than a single ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation examination performed by an experienced laboratory diagnostician.  A single ELISA is approximately equivalent to performing three ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation examinations. This ELISA does not require the skill level and experience that are necessary for an accurate morphological diagnosis.  One disadvantage of ELISA is expense: it detects only one pathogen, whereas fecal flotation can detect multiple parasites. In addition, ELISA produces positive results for a prolonged period of time in animals that have been treated, have recovered, and no longer appear to be shedding cysts in the feces. Therefore, it is not suitable for posttreatment monitoring or when a dog must test negative to reenter a canine day care facility.  Pearls & Pitfalls  ELISA remains positive for prolonged periods, so it is not suitable for posttreatment monitoring or when a dog must test negative to reenter a canine day care facility.  In cats with tritrichomoniasis, although the trophozoites of T blagburni are readily detected by direct smear, they cannot be differentiated from those of the nonpathogenic Pentatrichomonas spp. Definitive diagnosis requires the culturing of feces, followed by PCR assay.  Examination of Urine for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals The eggs of Pearsonema plica (syn Capillaria plica) and Dioctophyme renale might be detected in the sediment during urinalysis of dogs.  The eggs of P plica are bipolar plugged and contain a single embryo cell. The eggs of D renale have a thick shell wall, are slightly larger, and contain a two-celled embryo.  The bipolar-plugged eggs of Pearsonema feliscati (syn Capillaria feliscati) can be detected in the urine of cats.  Examination of Saliva-Sputum for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals See the discussion of F hirthi and O osleri under Baermann Examination above.  Examination of Blood for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals Blood samples are examined to detect infection by heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) and various bloodborne protozoal parasites (eg, Babesia spp, Cytauxzoon felis, Hepatozoon canis).  Testing for Heartworm Currently, both an antigen detection test and a microfilaria test are recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of heartworm infection in dogs.  Various commercial antigen test options are available for detecting D immitis infection in dogs and cats. These tests detect circulating adult female antigens and are recommended for use in animals that were exposed at least 7 months before testing.  The tests are so accurate and sensitive that clinicians can easily forget that both false-negative and false-positive results are still possible. Previously, false-negatives were thought to occur only if the animal was tested too soon after exposure (ie, before 7 months) or if very few female worms were present. It is now recognized that some dogs test negative even when a large worm burden is present, because the antigen can be sequestered in antibody-antigen complexes.  The current recommendation of doing both an antigen test and a microfilaria test achieves the greatest detection sensitivity. The microfilaria tests with the highest detection sensitivity are the modified Knott's test and the filter test. Both tests examine anticoagulated blood, mixed with formalin and dyed with methylene blue, to enable identification of microfilariae on a microscope slide, as outlined here:  Modified Knott's test:  1 mL of anticoagulated blood (EDTA or heparin) is added to 9 mL of 2% formalin in a 15-mL test tube.  The blood is immediately mixed with the formalin by inverting the test tube up and down 5–6 times.  The sample is centrifuged (173 g for 5 minutes).  The supernatant is poured off.  1–2 drops of 0.1% methylene blue are added, and the sediment is resuspended into the dye by stirring with an applicator stick.  The solution is pipetted onto a slide, coverslipped, and examined using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  The entire volume of the 0.1% methylene blue–sediment mixture is microscopically examined.  Filter test:  1 mL of anticoagulated blood (EDTA or heparin) is added to 9 mL of 2% formalin in a syringe.  The blood is immediately mixed with the formalin by inverting the syringe up and down 5–6 times  The syringe is attached to a filter holder containing a 25-mm filter with a 5-mcm pore size.  The plunger is depressed, pushing the entire mixture through the filter.  The syringe is refilled with water, and the water mixture is pushed through the filter.  The syringe is refilled with air, and the air is pushed through the filter.  The filter holder is unscrewed, and the filter is removed with a forceps and placed on a microscope slide (syringe side up).  One drop of 0.1% methylene blue is added, and the sample is coverslipped and examined using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  Note that 25–33% of infected dogs have no circulating microfilariae, making the infection undetectable by these tests.  Besides containing D immitis microfilariae, canine blood samples in North America might also contain microfilariae of the nonpathogenic, subcutaneous-dwelling worm Acanthocheilonema reconditum (formerly Dipetalonema reconditum). The microfilariae of D immitis and A reconditum can be differentiated by size and morphology using the modified Knott's test (see Knott's test sample image). They cannot be differentiated with the filter test.  Modified Knott’s test sample, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Less sensitive methods of detection are the direct blood smear (drop of blood placed on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and examined for microfilariae) and the hematocrit tube test (blood is centrifuged, and the buffy coat is examined microscopically as microfilariae migrate into the plasma). In addition, microfilariae can be detected on a dried blood smear stained with Wright-Giemsa stain.  Diagnosis of heartworm infection in cats is based on a combination of the antigen test and an antibody test. The antigen tests are less useful in cats than in dogs because of the lower worm burdens that typically occur in cats.  Available for use in cats, antibody tests detect circulating antibody and therefore detect exposure. Both tests of cats that are currently infected and of cats that have been exposed in the past give positive results. Because infected cats rarely have circulating microfilariae, microfilaria tests are not recommended for use in cats.  Testing for Bloodborne Protozoa The bloodborne protozoal parasites Babesia spp, Cytauxzoon felis, and Hepatozoon canis can be detected on dried, Giemsa-stained hematology blood smears and by immunological and molecular methods.  Parasitemia is the most pronounced in the acute phase of the infection and therefore can be detected on stained blood smears. As infections become more chronic, parasitemia might not be present, necessitating immunological methods (ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, indirect hemagglutination assay) or molecular methods.  Morphological Identification To achieve the expertise necessary for making accurate morphological identification of various immature parasite stages requires a high level of training and experience. A very subjective acquired skill, it requires the ability to recognize and evaluate subtle morphological characteristics. An extremely valuable tool that adds objective data to morphological assessment of parasite stages is an ocular micrometer.  An ocular micrometer is a small scale that fits into the eyepiece of the compound microscope and is calibrated for each objective of the microscope. It allows the user to measure the size of each parasite found on the slide, thereby facilitating accurate characterization and diagnosis. It is relatively inexpensive and can be easily moved to another microscope as needed. Ocular micrometers can be purchased from any microscope dealer.  Internal Parasite (Endoparasite) Diagnosis in Horses and Production Animals Fresh fecal samples from production animals should be collected from pasture, barn, or, preferably, the animal's rectum using plastic gloves. Samples should be placed in a properly identified, sealed specimen jar. Samples > 6 hours old are unsuitable for the same reasons that are stated above for pet fecal sample collection.\n","Successfully saved 'clinical_hematology' to Google Drive\n","add another file?

The protocols for sample collection and submission are therefore also subject to change.  The practitioner and diagnostic laboratory staff must maintain good communication to complete their diagnostic efforts efficiently and provide optimal service to the client. Practitioners must be specific and clear in their test requests. The laboratory staff will provide guidance regarding sample collection and handling protocols, as well as assistance in the interpretation of test results.  Most diagnostic laboratories publish user guidelines with preferred protocols for sample collection and submission; however, the following broad recommendations are fairly standard.  A detailed case history should be included with submitted samples. This information is particularly critical for the interpretation of samples submitted for cytologic and histologic evaluation. The submission form should be protected in a waterproof bag to avoid damage from any fluids in the packaged materials.  A detailed case history should include the following elements:  owner's first and last name  species  breed or size/weight (if breed unknown)  sex  age  animal identification  relevant clinical signs  gross appearance (including size and anatomic location) of lesions  previous treatment, including response to treatment (if any)  results of relevant diagnostic testing, such as CBC, serum biochemical analysis, cytologic and histologic evaluation, and imaging studies  for population health studies, morbidity and mortality in the group  If a zoonotic disease is suspected, this should also be clearly indicated on the submission form to alert laboratory personnel.  Packaging of Samples from Animals for Shipment The shipment of biological specimens should comply with protocols established by the courier or shipping service used. In some instances, air transport requires compliance with International Aviation and Transportation Association (IATA) regulations for hazardous materials.  These regulations include restrictions on the volume of formalin that can be shipped in a container: no more than 30 mL of free liquid solution in each inner container, and no more than 1 L in the entire outer package. Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Shipments with fresh tissue samples are required to be clearly labeled:  UN2814, Infectious substances, affecting humans  UN2900, Infectious substances, affecting animals  UN3373, Biological substances, Category B  Most veterinary diagnostic samples are classified as Category B (an infectious substance not in a form generally capable of causing permanent disability or life-threatening or fatal disease in otherwise healthy humans or animals when exposure to it occurs). If high-risk or reportable diseases are suspected, it is essential to contact state and federal veterinary agencies regarding necessary shipment precautions.  Further details can be found at the International Air Transport Association website and the US Postal Service Postal Explorer website as well as commercial courier websites.  A fundamental approach to packaging samples involves a 3-layer barrier to protect them:  The sample is placed in an appropriate primary container (sealed jar, bag, or tube).  The primary container is then enclosed within a secondary container, which also includes absorbent material.  The secondary container is then placed in the shipping box (tertiary container), which often houses refrigerant or cold packs as well as various cushioning materials (eg, polystyrene foam) to protect the sample. Ideally, the tertiary container is a sturdy polystyrene refrigerator box or a cardboard box lined with a fitted polystyrene lining.  Items such as syringes, obstetrical gloves, and containers without sealable orifices are not suitable for shipment. Under no circumstances should needles, scalpel blades, or any other potentially injurious item (eg, broken microscope slides with sharp edges) be submitted to the lab.  Liquid samples should not ship in plastic bags; instead, a sealable jar should be used. Waterproof markers should be used when labeling specimen bags and containers; at a minimum, patient identification and specimen type (eg, urine, serum, plasma) are critical labeling information.  Coolant materials should be sealed in separate plastic bags to prevent condensation damage. Refrigerant or cold packs should not be placed in direct contact with samples, such as tubes of whole blood, that could suffer adverse effects if frozen in transit.  The suitably protected, completed submission form must be included.  If dry ice is used, this should be noted on the cardboard box label, and the lid should not be sealed with tape. Otherwise, CO2 released from the dry ice could increase pressure and damage the package or contents.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Histologic Evaluation Tissues for microscopic examination collected either via biopsy or during necropsy can be critical to obtaining a diagnosis. Immunohistochemical (IHC) and other advanced tests that can be applied to formalin-fixed tissue further reinforce the utility of histologic evaluation as diagnostic technique.  Autolyzed tissues are generally useless for histologic evaluation; prompt necropsy and organ sampling are critical.  Tissue should not be frozen prior to fixation.  Other than CNS tissues, samples collected for histologic evaluation should never be > 1 cm thick (preferably 5–7 mm) and must be immediately placed in ≥ 10 times their volume of phosphate-buffered 10% formalin to ensure adequate fixation.  Tissues should be representative of any lesions present and, in the case of cutaneous punch biopsies and biopsies obtained via endoscopic collection, be centered directly on the grossly visible lesions.  Wedge biopsies or tissue samples collected at necropsy should include some of the apparently normal surrounding tissue; the interface between normal and abnormal tissue may provide key information.  Excisional biopsies of small tumors (< 1.5 cm) may be cut in half. Larger tumors may be sliced like bread so that formalin can penetrate to the face of each slice. Alternatively, several representative samples (7 mm wide, including the interface of normal and abnormal) may be collected.  Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Rather than shipping large volumes of formalin, tissue samples can be fixed in-house for at least 24 hours in an appropriate volume and then transferred into a smaller volume of fresh formalin for shipment.  Submission of tissue that has been stored in formalin is acceptable within any time frame, although quality of sample will degrade over time. Prolonged formalin fixation can adversely affect advanced testing; for example, immunohistochemical testing is not recommended for tissue that has been stored in formalin for > 7 weeks because results may be invalid.  Samples should be shipped in laboratory-approved unbreakable containers with screw-top lids and packed in a manner that prevents spillage or freezing during shipment (see Packaging of Samples for Shipment).  Specific tissues collected at necropsy require additional attention:  Because the GI mucosa decomposes rapidly, short sections of gut collected at necropsy should be opened lengthwise to allow adequate fixation.  If the spinal cord is submitted, the dura mater should be carefully incised lengthwise to permit more rapid penetration to the cord.  Fixing the brain poses a special dilemma, especially if a neuroanatomical location of the lesions within the organ could not be determined antemortem.  Ideally, a whole, intact, fixed brain is required for complete histologic evaluation.  Immersion of the brain for many days in a large volume of formalin is required for adequate fixation; consequently, brains are commonly transported in an only partially fixed state. If the specimen can be shipped by overnight delivery, it may be acceptable to send a chilled, carefully packaged, unfixed brain, which can then be processed at the diagnostic laboratory.  Often, the brain is halved longitudinally and one half is sent unfixed (fresh), properly refrigerated, for microbiological testing, while the other half partially fixes in transit. This method can prove unsatisfactory if a solitary unilateral lesion is involved. Slicing the brain into widths suitable for rapid fixation introduces considerable fixation artifact and should be avoided if possible; fixing the intact (or halved) brain in a large volume of formalin for > 24 hours is preferred.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Microbiological Testing Any specific infectious agents that are suspected clinically should be noted on the submission form; some organisms have specific growth requirements (eg, anaerobic culture, special media) that may not be routinely used in laboratories unless the pathogen was cited as a differential diagnosis.  Laboratory techniques and capabilities for microbiological testing vary; however, most tests rely on either the growth or visualization of intact viable organisms or the detection of the nucleic acids and proteins of these pathogens. Therefore, unfixed specimens (tissue, fluid, etc) should be collected aseptically and shipped promptly to avoid degradation.  If microbial culture of a fluid specimen such as urine or a cavitary effusion is a possibility, a separate aliquot of the fluid in a sterile, additive-free container should be submitted. Tubes containing EDTA or other preservatives are generally ideal for cytologic evaluation but unacceptable for culturing.  If PCR assays are to be performed, it is particularly important to avoid cross contamination between multiple animals in a submission; this principle applies to tissues, fluids, and even dissection instruments.  Furthermore, swabs for PCR analysis should not be placed in agar or charcoal-based transport media, and calcium alginate swabs should be avoided. Instead, sterile cotton- or polyester-tipped applicators should be shipped in a tube, either dry (without transport media) or with a few drops of sterile saline solution or viral transport media, depending on the individual laboratory's requirements.  Requirements for PCR assay can vary widely by specific PCR test, and consulting the recipient laboratory before obtaining the sample is strongly encouraged.  Some test protocols may permit pooling of organ specimens from an individual; however, it is generally preferable that each tissue be collected into separate, clearly labeled sterile bags or tubes for shipping. Gut samples must never be pooled in a container with other tissue samples.  Tissues and fluids for most microbiological assays may be frozen before shipment, but freezing is generally undesirable if samples can be chilled and delivered directly to the laboratory within 24 hours after collection.  Exceptions to this rule include analysis for certain toxins, such as those of Clostridium perfringens and C botulinum, in which degradation of the toxin must be prevented by prompt freezing after collection. Adequate coolant should be provided so that samples remain chilled (or frozen) until they reach the laboratory.  Fecal samples for parasitological testing should be submitted chilled in appropriately sealed containers. Freezing may have little impact on routine flotation or sedimentation tests but will negate the possibility of Baermann analysis for nematode larvae. Ectoparasites or nematodes being submitted for identification should be submitted in vials containing 70% alcohol.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Toxicological Testing If a known toxin is suspected, a specific analysis should always be requested—laboratories cannot just “check for poisoning.” A complete description of clinical and epidemiological findings may help differentiate poisoning from infectious diseases that mimic poisoning.  Pearls & Pitfalls  If a known toxin is suspected, a specific analysis should always be requested—laboratories cannot just “check for poisoning.”  The most critical samples to be collected are generally the following:  gastric contents  liver  kidney  whole blood  plasma or serum  urine  There are also some exceptions, such as the collection of cerebral tissue for cholinesterase analysis.  For some investigations, the diagnosis requires analysis of feed or water. If there is doubt regarding sample submission procedures, the laboratory should be contacted.  Freezing is critical to prevent the degradation of a few analytes, such as cholinesterase, zinc phosphide, and sodium fluoroacetate (compound 1080). However, for most analytes, overnight shipping of chilled specimens will suffice.  The containers for packing and transporting specimens should be free of chemicals. Plastic containers (eg, jars) are ideal, and jars with metal tops should be avoided. Samples should be packed individually and all containers labeled.  If legal action is a possibility, all containers for shipment should be either sealed so that tampering can be detected or hand-carried to the laboratory and a receipt obtained. The chain of custody must be accurately documented.  If feed or water is suspected as the source of poisoning, chilled samples of these along with any descriptive feed tag should accompany the tissue samples. If at all possible, a representative composite sample of the feed should be submitted from the suspect lot or shipment (ie, aliquots from the top, middle, and bottom of the feed container).  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Hematological Testing Routine hematological tests require anticoagulated whole blood filled to the appropriate fill volume for the specimen collection tube. Overfilling or underfilling of tubes can cause unreliable analytic results due to an incorrect blood-additive ratio.  Ideally, several blood smears should be included. Blood smears should be prepared immediately after the sample has been collected in order to minimize artifacts, including altered erythrocyte morphology, platelet clumping, and general cell deterioration.  Anticoagulated blood should be kept refrigerated; blood smears should be stored at room temperature. EDTA is the anticoagulant of choice for mammalian CBCs.  EDTA is acceptable for most, but not all, nonmammalian species. Blood from stingrays, some bony fish, and some reptilian and avian species undergoes hemolysis when collected into EDTA, so heparin is commonly used for these species.  Blood for coagulation testing should be collected into a citrate (blue-top) tube containing trisodium citrate (3.2% or 3.8%, as specified by the reference laboratory). It is imperative that the tube be filled to the appropriate fill volume because underfilling can cause falsely prolonged clotting times.  For plasma-based assays, citrated plasma typically must be separated from whole blood within 6 hours after collection for measurement of prothrombin time (PT) and activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). Plasma is separated by centrifugation at 1,500g for 15 minutes, after which the plasma is transferred to an additive-free plastic secondary tube using a disposable plastic pipette.  Plasma should ideally be analyzed within 1 hour after separation. However, many samples for coagulation testing are sent to reference laboratories for analysis, and adherence to laboratory-specific guidelines pertaining to specimen storage is advised.  Freezing of whole blood causes cell lysis and gross hemolysis, which interfere with testing; freezing of whole blood (during storage or specimen transport) must be avoided.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Serum Biochemical Analysis Anticoagulants present in plasma may result in spuriously increased or decreased test analyte values (eg, samples contaminated with potassium-EDTA have artifactually elevated potassium concentrations and decreased calcium concentrations); therefore, by default, serum should be submitted.  However, in some instances, heparinized plasma may be acceptable or, possibly, required. Consultation with the lab before collecting the specimen is recommended for any nonroutine tests or species.  Because lipemia can interfere with a number of chemistry tests for dogs and cats, food withholding is advisable for 12 hours before samples are collected unless there is a potential medical contraindication, such as with pediatric patients or toy dog breeds.  For serum samples, the blood should be drawn into a serum (red-top) tube or serum separator (tiger-top) tube. The sample should be held at room temperature for 20–30 minutes to allow complete clot formation and retraction. Incomplete clot formation may cause the serum to gel due to latent fibrin formation.  The clot should be separated from the glass by gently rimming the tube walls with an applicator stick to loosen the clot. The sample should then be centrifuged at moderate speed (~450 rpm) for 10 minutes.  If the sample has been collected into a serum separator tube, centrifugation will cause a layer of polymer gel to lodge between the packed cells and the serum. The gel layer should be inspected to ensure the integrity of the barrier, and repeated centrifugation is recommended if there is a visible crack in this layer.  If a serum (red-top) tube has been used, the serum should be removed and transferred to a clean tube to minimize artifacts (eg, glycolysis in the cellular component of the blood sample may result in an artifactually decreased glucose concentration). Serum should be refrigerated or frozen until analyzed. Delays in analysis may adversely affect the results for a number of analytes.  Rough handling of the sample or incomplete separation of erythrocytes from serum may promote hemolysis, which can interfere with certain tests. For chemistry panels, 0.5 mL of serum is typically preferred, although minimum laboratory requirements may vary and should be consulted for serum volumes < 0.5 mL.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Urinalysis Urine samples should be clearly labeled with specimen type because urine and serum may be grossly indistinguishable.  Noting the method through which the urine was obtained (free catch, catheterization, cystocentesis, etc) can be helpful for interpretation of findings; for example, free catch samples may have bacterial contaminants from the external genitalia and perineum, and catheterized samples often have greater numbers of transitional epithelial or urothelial cells due to mechanical exfoliation from passing of the catheter.  Clear specimen containers can facilitate gross examination of the urine. However, if urine is not evaluated within 30 minutes after collection, care must be taken to protect it from exposure to ultraviolet light, which causes degradation of urine constituents, including bilirubin.  Lids must be securely screwed on to prevent leakage, evaporation, or volatilization of ketones (if present). Containers must not be reused because traces of detergent can interfere with chemical analysis and bacterial contaminants can proliferate during specimen storage and transit.   Urine should be stored and shipped chilled, although it should be noted that crystal precipitation can occur. Urine is a caustic environment that causes rapid degradation of formed elements, including cells.  If urinary tract disease reflected by the sediment examination (eg, inflammation, infection, proliferative process involving neoplasia) is suspected, cytologic smears prepared from fresh urine sediment should be submitted along with the urine sample. Cytologic smears are air-dried and are prepared as described in the Samples for Cytologic Evaluation section.  As with other fluid samples, volume requirements apply to samples for urinalysis. The preferred volume is generally 5–6 mL, although lesser volumes may be accepted, depending on the lab.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Serologic Testing Serologic testing generally requires serum, but plasma is often satisfactory. Samples should be collected as described for serum biochemical analysis and should always be free of hemolysis.  In some instances, paired samples may be required for an adequate diagnosis. The acute sample should be collected early in the course of the disease and frozen. The convalescent sample should be collected 10–14 days later, and both samples should be forwarded to the laboratory at the same time.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Cytologic Evaluation For superficial mass effects, sampling by fine needle (ie, aspiration or coring/\"woodpecker\" technique) is typically of higher diagnostic yield and more representative of the primary lesion than samples obtained via surface impression. Impression smears are prone to contamination with debris and flora of the skin or environment, or may represent only secondary inflammation or infection.   Aspirated material must be spread into a monolayer (ie, approximately half the cells touch but do not overlap) after application to the slide (see lymphocyte and mesenchymal cell slides).

The preferred spreading method involves gentle horizontal smearing using a second slide that is placed on top of the material after it is deposited on the bottom slide (see optimal preparation slide). This technique is superior to the vertical pull-apart technique (see pull-apart preparation slide).   Cytology smear with optimal preparation technique   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Pull-apart slide preparation   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive specimen density and cytolysis inhibit the ability to adequately evaluate cells in cytologic specimens (see Excessive specimen density, low magnification and high magnification slides; see also Excessive cytolysis (cell lysis) slide). Only intact cells can be evaluated cytologically because cytolysis introduces artifacts that can mimic malignancy, such as enlargement of nuclei and increased prominence of nucleoli.  Excessive specimen density, low magnification   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive specimen density, high magnification   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Excessive cytolysis (cell lysis)   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Both the pull-apart technique and the lack of any effort to spread the material (ie, simple air drying of droplet-form deposited biological material) are prone to excessive specimen density and cytolysis, and may be nondiagnostic (see dense specimen without spreading slide).  Specimen deposited on slide without spreading   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Samples with a fluidic component can be spread in the same manner as blood smears. Highly cellular fluids may be smeared directly; fluids of low cellularity should be centrifuged to concentrate the cells.  Slides should be stored at room temperature and protected from dust as well as excessive humidity and prolonged exposure to light. It is important to physically label slides with patient identification as well as the source of the cytologic sample; labeling only slide boxes or cartons is unreliable because slides may be separated from the containers or containers reused.  Samples containing excessive ultrasound or lubricant gel may be nondiagnostic because this material is microscopically opaque and obscures cells as well as causing poor cellular stain uptake.  Other practical considerations for preparation of cytologic samples include always using fresh slides, avoidance of coverslips and acetate tape, and ensuring that cellular material is deposited towards the center of a single side of the slide (see specimen on both sides slide).  As digital scanning of slides becomes more prevalent in diagnostic labs, it is not possible for a pathologist to simply flip over the slide on their microscope to focus on the material on the opposite slide. In addition, if the material on the two sides overlaps, it is possible that the net effect will be material that is too thick to adequately assess.  Specimen present on both sides of the slide   Image Courtesy of Dr. Rebekah Gunn-Christie.  Exposure of blood and cytologic smears to formalin or formalin fumes (including proximity to sealed jars of formalin) will interfere with adequate staining and evaluation, potentially resulting in a nondiagnostic specimen. These slide preparations must never be submitted to the laboratory in the same package as formalin-fixed tissues.  Air-dried, unfixed smears are usually appropriate for immunocytochemical (ICC) staining; however, in some instances, shipping samples in tubes containing transport media is recommended. If special stains including ICC are anticipated, the laboratory should be contacted prior to submission to ensure their laboratory-specific protocol is followed.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Fluid Analysis Analysis of cavitary (peritoneal, pleural, and pericardial) effusions and other fluids (eg, synovial fluid, CSF) includes determination of protein content, total erythrocyte and WBC counts, and cytologic evaluation. Other tests may be performed depending on the source or appearance (eg, chylous fluid) of the effusion.  A sample of fluid should be collected into an EDTA (purple-top) tube for routine analysis. A second sample should be collected into a serum (red-top) tube if microbial culture and antimicrobial susceptibility testing or biochemical analyses are anticipated. These samples should be shipped chilled but not frozen.  Cytologic evaluation without measurement of other parameters (eg, total protein concentration, cell counts) is usually acceptable for mass effects characterized by a fluidic component.  Smears for cytologic evaluation should be prepared from a drop of the fluid immediately after the sample has been collected to minimize cell deterioration and other in vitro artifacts. Cytologic slides should be labeled with patient ID, source, and type of preparation (eg, direct, concentrated/sediment) and fluid and then submitted to the lab.  Samples of CSF should be collected into small EDTA tubes and shipped immediately with high priority; the cytologic value of CSF samples degrades rapidly, and the low cellularity makes examination of direct smears unrewarding. If sufficient CSF is available, then a serum (red-top) tube sample may be useful for serologic evaluation or culture attempts.  Preparation of Samples from Animals for Flow Cytometry Flow cytometry can be performed on samples with an inherently fluidic composition (whole blood, cavitary effusions) and on organ (eg, lymph node, bone marrow) aspirates collected into fluid medium. Intact, well-preserved cells are necessary for accurate results. Consequently, samples 48 hours old or less are usually needed to ensure cell viability.  Specimen volumes can vary, depending on type of sample (eg, whole blood versus organ aspirate), and the lab should be consulted before collection of the specimen.  The lab may have additional recommendations pertaining to sample collection and submission. For example, depending on specimen transit times, it may be advisable to submit samples early in the week to avoid delays spanning the weekend.  Preparation of Samples for Genetic Analysis in Animals Tests based on the detection of specific genetic features range from karyotype analysis to the identification of specific genes.  The laboratory offering the test should be contacted to determine the specifics of sample collection and handling; required samples range from hair to skin or blood. Many blood-based analyses require collection into acid-citrate-dextrose (yellow-top) tubes and overnight shipment of chilled tubes to the laboratory.  Tissue samples for genetic analysis should be unfixed and shipped immediately after collection. As with most molecular techniques, aseptic collection and the prevention of cross contamination between samples is critical for reliable test results.  Key Points Overview of Diagnostic Procedures for the Private Practice Laboratory ByTrevor J. Whitbread, BVSc, DECVP, Abbey Veterinary Services/NationWide Laboraties; Karen W. Post, DVM, MS, DACVM, North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, Consumer Services, Rollins Animal Disease, Diagnostic Laboratory;Charles M. Hendrix, DVM, PhD, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University Reviewed/Revised Jun 2015 | Modified Sept 2024 Numerous laboratory tests can be done in a private practice laboratory. Use of a commercial laboratory versus in-house testing should be evaluated to determine whether in-house testing is practical and economical. Because the availability of diagnostic laboratories and their reporting intervals may be problematic (eg, nights and holidays), performing some diagnostic screening tests in-house is often desirable. However, because the people performing these tests often have minimal technical training, quality control procedures must be rigorous. The time and care that must be devoted to quality control issues may preclude in-house testing in many practices. Errors may occur not only in testing procedures but also in sample collection and handling and in recording results.  Tests can be done using either manual or automated methods. Manual methods tend to be time consuming and are more subject to human error. Automated and semiautomated systems are available but are more expensive. Factors to be considered include instrument and reagent costs (including materials for calibration and quality control), availability of personnel training, technical support, and instrument maintenance and service. Although service contracts can cost up to 10% of the purchase price of an instrument, they are often cost-effective because of the expense of instrument repair Clinical Biochemistry ByTrevor J. Whitbread, BVSc, DECVP, Abbey Veterinary Services/NationWide Laboraties; Karen W. Post, DVM, MS, DACVM, North Carolina Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory System, Consumer Services, Rollins Animal Disease, Diagnostic Laboratory;Charles M. Hendrix, DVM, PhD, Department of Pathobiology, College of Veterinary Medicine, Auburn University Reviewed/Revised Jun 2015 | Modified Sept 2024 Basic Test Panel: | Additional Tests: | Tests for Pancreatic Disease: | Handling of Samples: | Point-of-Care Tests: | The Practice Laboratory: Clinical biochemistry refers to the analysis of the blood plasma (or serum) for a wide variety of substances—substrates, enzymes, hormones, etc—and their use in diagnosis and monitoring of disease. Analysis of other body fluids (eg, urine, ascitic fluids, CSF) is also included. One test is very seldom specific to one clinical condition, and basic checklists of factors affecting the most commonly requested analytes are given below. Thus, rather than six tests that merely confirm or deny six possibilities, a well-chosen group of six tests can provide information pointing to a wide variety of different conditions by a process of pattern recognition. Biochemistry tests should be accompanied by full hematology, because evaluation of both together is essential for optimal recognition of many of the most characteristic disease patterns ( see Clinical Hematology).  Before samples are collected, a list of differential diagnoses should already be established based on the history and clinical examination. Then, additional appropriate tests can be added to the basic panel below.  Making a diagnosis entails establishing a list of differential diagnoses based on the history and clinical examination. Based on this list, tests can be selected to include or exclude as many of the differentials as possible. Yet more tests may be necessary until only one of the original list remains to determine the diagnosis. If all differentials are excluded, then the list must be reevaluated. It is not good practice to order tests without a sensible differential list unless the animal presents without definitive clinical signs.  Basic Test Panel: Most veterinary laboratories offer a basic panel of tests, which represents a minimal investigation applicable to most general situations. For small animals, a typical panel includes total protein, albumin, globulin (calculated as the difference between the first two analytes), urea, creatinine, ALT, and alkaline phosphatase (ALP). In addition, a yellow color seen in the plasma should be considered an indication to measure bilirubin. This panel may be modified as appropriate for other species, eg, glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) and/or gamma-glutamyl transferase (GGT) are more appropriate “liver enzymes” for horses and farm animals, or it may be more appropriate to concentrate primarily on muscle enzymes (CK and AST) in athletic animals.  Total protein level increases due to dehydration, chronic inflammation, and paraproteinemia. It decreases due to overhydration, severe congestive heart failure (with edema), protein-losing nephropathy, protein-losing enteropathy, hemorrhage, burns, dietary protein deficiency, malabsorption, and some viral conditions (especially in horses).  Albumin level increases due to dehydration. It decreases due to the same factors as total protein, plus liver failure.  Urea level increases due to excess dietary protein, poor quality dietary protein, carbohydrate deficiency, catabolic states, dehydration, congestive heart failure, renal failure, blocked urethra, and ruptured bladder. It decreases due to low dietary protein, gross sepsis, anabolic hormonal effects, liver failure, portosystemic shunts (congenital or acquired), and inborn errors of urea cycle metabolism. Urea measurement is used especially to indicate renal disease and to a lesser extent liver dysfunction.  Creatinine level increases due to renal dysfunction, blocked urethra, and ruptured bladder. It decreases due to sample deterioration. Animals with a high muscle mass have high-normal creatinine concentrations, whereas animals with a low muscle mass have low-normal creatinine concentrations. Creatinine measurement is used especially for renal disease.  ALT is present in the cytoplasm and mitochondria of liver cells and, therefore, increases due to hepatocellular damage. It has a half life of 2–4 hr and rises higher than AST but recovers quicker. There are minor increases with muscle damage and hyperthyroidism.  ALP level increases due to increased bone deposition, liver damage, hyperthyroidism, biliary tract disease, intestinal damage, hyperadrenocorticism, corticosteroid administration, barbiturate administration, and generalized tissue damage (including neoplasia). The most common causes for an increase is raised levels of circulating steroids and biliary disease. The half-life is 72 hr in dogs but only 6 hr in cats. Levels in the cat are generally much lower than in the dog, and any increase in cats is considered significant. In dogs, ALP levels in the thousands of units are usually associated with increased steroid levels. ALP and ALT levels rarely rise above 1,000 units, even in severe liver disease.  GDH level increases in hepatocellular damage, particularly hepatic necrosis, in horses and ruminants.  GGT increases in longer-term liver damage; it is particularly useful in horses and ruminants.  CK, the classic “muscle enzyme,” increases markedly in rhabdomyolysis and aortic thromboembolism. Slight level increases are reported in hypothyroidism. Only a very small amount of muscle damage such as bruising or IM injections can result in high serum CK levels. In dogs and cats, unless investigating specific muscle disease, increased levels are generally of no clinical significance.  AST level increases in both muscle and liver damage but is of less value than ALT. The half-life is 5 hr in dogs and 77 min in cats. It is also reported to increase in hypothyroidism.  Most of the above parameters are associated with liver function/dysfunction and are frequently overinterpreted. In small animals, increases in ALT and ALP levels can reach four times normal and still be associated only with fatty change, a nonspecific finding and not, in most cases, a primary liver problem. Some laboratories also frequently receive liver biopsies from dogs that have significant increases in liver enzymes and bile acids >80 but that have normal histologic morphology. The reason for this is unknown.  In general, plasma enzyme levels decrease due to sample deterioration. Uncommonly, atrophy or fibrosis of an organ may result in unusually low plasma activities of the relevant enzymes.  Additional Tests: Further tests may be added to the basic panel, according to the principal presenting signs, to create panels for polydipsic animals, collapsing animals, etc. These panels are structured so that the patterns of abnormalities typical of all the likely differential diagnoses applicable to the situation can be discerned. For example, a polydipsia panel may add calcium, glucose, and cholesterol. Calcium allows recognition of hyperparathyroidism and other causes of hypercalcemia (which causes polydipsia and renal insufficiency), glucose may indicate diabetes mellitus and contributes to the pattern characteristic of hyperadrenocorticism, and cholesterol also adds to the appreciation of the “Cushing pattern.” Renal failure is covered by the tests already included in the basic panel. In contrast, in a panel for a \"collapsing animal,” calcium and glucose may be added to screen for hypocalcemia or hypoglycemia. Sodium and potassium are included to screen for hypoadrenocorticism or hypokalemia. Analytes that might be considered for incorporation in such expanded profiles are described below.  Sodium level increases due to Conn syndrome (hyperaldosteronism), restricted water intake, vomiting, and most causes of dehydration. It decreases due to hypoadrenocorticism, loss of any high-sodium fluid such as some forms of renal disease, and insufficient sodium provision during IV fluid therapy.  Potassium level increases due to hypoadrenocorticism and severe renal failure (especially terminal cases). It decreases due to Conn syndrome, chronic renal dysfunction, vomiting, diarrhea, and insufficient potassium provision during IV fluid therapy. Congenital hypokalemia occurs in Burmese cats.  Chloride level increases in acidosis, and in parallel with increases in sodium concentration. It decreases in alkalosis, vomiting (especially after eating), and in association with hyponatremia.  Total CO2 (bicarbonate) level increases in metabolic alkalosis and decreases in metabolic acidosis. It is less useful to assess respiratory acid/base disturbances.  Calcium level increases due to dehydration (which is also associated with increased albumin), primary hyperparathyroidism (neoplasia of parathyroid gland), primary pseudohyperparathyroidism (neoplasms producing parathormone-related peptide [PRP], usually perianal adenocarcinoma or some form of lymphosarcoma), bone invasion of malignant neoplasms, thyrotoxicosis (uncommon), and overtreatment of parturient paresis. It decreases due to hypoalbuminemia, parturient paresis, oxalate poisoning, chronic renal failure (secondary renal hyperparathyroidism), acute pancreatitis (occasionally), surgical interference with parathyroid glands, and idiopathic (autoimmune) hypoparathyroidism.  Phosphate level increases due to renal failure (secondary renal hyperparathyroidism). Decreases are seen in some downer cows and as part of the stress pattern in horses and small animals.  Magnesium level increases are rarely seen, including during acute renal failure. It decreases in ruminants due to dietary deficiency, either acute (grass staggers) or chronic, and diarrhea (uncommon).  Glucose level increases due to high-carbohydrate meals, sprint exercise, stress or excitement (including handling and sampling stress), glucocorticoid therapy, hyperadrenocorticism, overinfusion with glucose/dextrose-containing IV fluids, and diabetes mellitus. It decreases due to insulin overdose, insulinoma, islet cell hyperplasia (uncommon), acetonemia/pregnancy toxemia, acute febrile illness, and idiopathically (in certain dog breeds).  β-Hydroxybutyrate level increases in diabetes mellitus. It is a major component of ketoacidosis and as such is also increased in acetonemia/pregnancy toxemia and extreme starvation. It can be measured in both blood and urine.  Bilirubin level increases due to fasting (benign effect in horses and squirrel monkeys, may be caused by hepatic lipidosis in cats), hemolytic disease (usually mild increase), liver dysfunction, and biliary obstruction (intra- or extrahepatic). Theoretically, hemolysis is characterized by an increase in unconjugated (indirect) bilirubin, whereas hepatic and post-hepatic disorders are characterized by an increase in conjugated (direct) bilirubin; however, in practice this differentiation is unsatisfactory. Better appreciation of the source of the jaundice is gained from bile acid measurements.  Bile acid levels increase when hepatic anion transport is impaired, usually during liver dysfunction (bile acids are more sensitive than bilirubin to hepatic impairment) and in the presence of a portosystemic shunt (congenital or acquired). The latter condition is characterized by a marked increase in bile acid concentration after feeding, from a fasting concentration that may be normal. It also increases in bile duct obstruction; very little increase is seen in feline infectious peritonitis or mild cases of hepatic lipidosis. Very high levels can sometimes be seen without structural histologic changes. The reason for this is not known.  Cholesterol level increases due to fatty meals, hepatic or biliary disease, protein-losing nephropathy (and other protein-losing syndromes to some extent), diabetes mellitus, hyperadrenocorticism, and hypothyroidism. It decreases in some cases of severe liver dysfunction and occasionally in hyperthyroidism.  Lactate dehydrogenase is a ubiquitous enzyme with a number of isoenzymes; electrophoretic separation of isoenzymes is necessary to locate the source of increased activity. It is therefore of very limited value in general clinical practice.  Sorbitol dehydrogenase level increases in acute hepatocellular damage in horses but is a very labile analyte.  α-Amylase level increases in acute pancreatitis but in dogs is also increased in chronic renal dysfunction. It is therefore of limited use in the diagnosis of pancreatitis. Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity is now the test of choice for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats. Amylase is not a useful indicator of pancreatitis in cats.  Lipase level increases in acute pancreatitis in dogs (longer half-life than amylase) and also occasionally in chronic renal dysfunction. Lipase (routine assay) is not a useful indicator of pancreatitis in cats.  Immunoreactive trypsin (trypsin-like immunoreactivity) level decreases in exocrine pancreatic insufficiency in dogs. It will also increase (irregularly) in pancreatitis.  Tests for Pancreatic Disease: Pancreatitis: Serum amylase and lipase activities have been used for several decades to diagnose pancreatitis in both people and dogs. Unfortunately, neither of these tests is both sensitive and specific for pancreatitis in dogs. In one study, significant serum amylase and lipase activities remained after total pancreatectomy, indicating there are sources of serum amylase and lipase activity other than the exocrine pancreas. Also, clinical data suggest a specificity for pancreatitis of only ~50% for both of these markers. Many nonpancreatic diseases, such as renal, hepatic, intestinal, and neoplastic diseases, can lead to increases in serum amylase and lipase activities. Steroid administration can also increase serum lipase activity and cause variable responses in serum amylase activity. Thus, in dogs, measurement of serum amylase and lipase activities are of limited usefulness for diagnosis of pancreatitis. Serum amylase and/or lipase activities that are 3–5 times the upper limit of the reference range, in animals with clinical signs consistent with pancreatitis, are suggestive of such a diagnosis. However, it is important to note that ~50% of dogs that fulfill these criteria do not have pancreatitis. In cats, serum amylase and lipase activities are of no clinical value for diagnosis of pancreatitis. Although cats with experimental pancreatitis can show an increase in serum lipase activity and a decrease in serum amylase activity, these changes are not consistent in cats with spontaneous pancreatitis. In one study of 12 cats with severe forms of pancreatitis, not a single cat had serum lipase or amylase activity above the upper limit of the reference range.  Serum trypsin-like immunoreactivity (TLI) concentration measures mainly trypsinogen, the only form of trypsin circulating in the vascular space of healthy individuals. However, trypsin, if present in the serum, is also detected by these assays. Serum TLI concentrations can be measured by species-specific assays that have been developed and validated for both dogs and cats. In healthy animals, serum TLI is low, but during pancreatitis an increased amount of trypsinogen leaks into the vascular space, which can lead to an increase in serum TLI concentration. Trypsin that has been prematurely activated may also contribute to this increase. However, both trypsinogen and trypsin are quickly cleared by the kidneys. In addition, any prematurely activated trypsin is quickly removed by proteinase inhibitors, such as α1-proteinase inhibitor and α2-macroglobulin. In turn, α2-macroglobulin-trypsin complexes are removed by the reticuloendothelial system. Thus, the serum half-life for TLI is short, and a significant degree of active inflammation is required to increase serum TLI concentration. Because of the limited sensitivity of serum cTLI and fTLI concentrations for canine and feline pancreatitis, respectively, and because only a limited number of laboratories measure these assays routinely, serum TLI concentration is of limited usefulness for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats.  Pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (PLI) concentration measures the concentration of classical pancreatic lipase in the serum. This is in contrast to serum lipase activity, which measures the enzymatic activity of all triglyceridases present in the serum, regardless of their cellular origin. Assays to measure PLI in canine (cPLI) and feline (fPLI) serum have been developed and validated and are commercially available. Serum PLI is highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function. Also, serum PLI is far more sensitive for diagnosis of pancreatitis than any other diagnostic test currently available.  A patient-side semiquantitative assay for diagnosis of canine pancreatitis is also available. A test spot that is lighter in color than the reference spot suggests that pancreatitis can be excluded. A test spot darker in color than the reference spot raises the suspicion of pancreatitis and should prompt the clinician to measure a serum cPLI concentration in the laboratory.  Other tests for diagnosis of pancreatitis in dogs and cats have been evaluated, including plasma trypsinogen activation peptide (TAP) concentration, urine TAP concentration, urine TAP:creatinine ratio, serum α1-proteinase inhibitor trypsin complex concentration, and serum α2-macroglobulin concentration. However, none has been shown to be of clinical usefulness.  Exocrine Pancreatic Insufficiency: In the past, several fecal tests have been used to diagnose exocrine pancreatic insufficiency (EPI). Microscopic fecal examination for fat and/or undigested starch or muscle fibers are at best useful to suggest maldigestion. However, in light of wide availability of tests to diagnose EPI, microscopic fecal examination is no longer justified. Fecal proteolytic activity had been used to diagnose EPI in small animals for several decades. Most of these methods, particularly the radiographic film clearance test, are unreliable. One method, which uses pre-made tablets to pour a gelatin agar, is considered most reliable. However, false-positive as well as false-negative results have been reported. The clinical use of fecal proteolytic activity is limited to species for which more specific assays to estimate pancreatic function are not available and in areas where the more accurate and sophisticated tests are not available.  Serum TLI concentration is the diagnostic test of choice for EPI in both dogs and cats. Assays for TLI measure trypsinogen circulating in the vascular space. In healthy animals, only a small amount of trypsinogen is present in serum. However, in dogs and cats with EPI, the number of pancreatic acinar cells is severely decreased. Serum TLI concentration decreases significantly and may even be undetectable. The reference range for TLI in dogs is 5.7–45.2 mcg/L with a cut-off value of ≤2.5 mcg/L considered diagnostic for EPI. Similarly, the reference range for TLI in cats is 12–82 mcg/L, with a cut-off value of ≤8 mcg/L considered diagnostic. Rarely, animals with serum TLI concentrations below the cut-off value for EPI do not have clinical signs of EPI. This is probably because of the functional redundancy of the GI tract. At the same time, many dogs and cats with chronic diarrhea and weight loss have mild decreases in serum TLI concentration. Most of these animals have chronic small-intestinal disease and should be investigated accordingly. However, a small number of these dogs and cats may have EPI. If there is no evidence of small-intestinal disease in such patients, a trial therapy with pancreatic enzymes and reevaluation of serum TLI concentration after 1 mo is indicated.  PLI is also highly specific for exocrine pancreatic function and could be used to diagnose EPI. However, initial studies showed there is a small degree of overlap in serum PLI concentrations between healthy dogs and dogs with EPI, making the measurement of PLI slightly inferior to that of TLI for accurate diagnosis. In view of these findings, PLI assays for both dogs and cats have been optimized toward higher concentrations, and the current assays are no longer suitable for diagnosis of EPI in dogs or cats.  A fecal canine elastase concentration assay has been developed and validated but is inferior to the widely used TLI measurement.  Handling of Samples: Most biochemistry tests can be performed on either serum or heparinized plasma. A few (eg, insulin) require serum, whereas potassium is best measured on heparin plasma separated immediately after collection. Glucose measurement requires fluoride/oxalate plasma. Suitable collection tubes with and without anticoagulant are available commercially. Plastic tubes are satisfactory for blood in anticoagulant, but clotted blood must be collected either into glass tubes or plastic tubes specially coated to prevent the clot from adhering to the vessel walls.  Samples for biochemical analysis should be separated as soon as possible after collection to minimize artifacts caused by hemolysis and leakage of intracellular fluid components (eg, potassium) out of the cells. Samples in anticoagulant may be centrifuged immediately, but clotted samples need at least 30 min to allow the clot to form. Fluoride/oxalate samples hemolyze very readily because the cells can no longer respire, so timely separation is especially important. Proprietary gels or plastic beads assist with separation, and these may be incorporated into the collection tube or added before centrifugation.  Larger bucket-type centrifuges will accept almost any type or size of tube, but the rotors require careful balancing. They should be spun at 3,000 rpm for 10 min. Dual-purpose, high-speed microhematocrit centrifuges are favored for in-practice use, because they separate samples more quickly and the same machine can be used to measure PCV. However, they can handle only a limited range of small-volume tubes.  Some “gel-tube” products may provide a permanent separation of serum or plasma; otherwise, this must be separated into a fresh tube. The new tube must be adequately labeled. Samples may then be sent to a professional laboratory or analyzed in the practice.  Point-of-Care Tests: A number of biochemical analytes may be estimated in the practice without the need for large analytical instruments.  Total protein level is measured by refractometry, using the same instrument as is used to measure urine specific gravity, provided the instrument has a total protein scale. It is also valid for protein measurement of ascitic and pleural fluids. The readout may be in g/dL, in which case multiplying the result by 10 will yield the SI unit of g/L.  Urea level may be estimated by chromatographic reaction strips, which correlate well with standard laboratory methods. A rapid whole-blood color comparison strip is also available, but these read only up to ~20 mmol/L and are thus of limited use. A dedicated reflectance meter for urea estimation is not available.  Glucose meters for use on whole blood are widely available for home use by human diabetic patients. These yield acceptably accurate results on animal blood, although an unexpected hypoglycemia should be confirmed by a professional laboratory. Fresh whole blood may be used, but fluoride blood or plasma is the preferred sample if analysis is not immediate.  Ketone levels may be estimated on either urine (preferred sample) or plasma/serum. This can be achieved by using the ketone patch of a urine dipstick, giving a qualitative result. However, there are a number of point-of-care instruments for measurement of blood glucose and ketone levels, including specifically β-hydroxybutyrate.  Triglyceride levels may be visualized in a plasma or serum sample as lipemia. If the milkiness rises to the top of the tube on storage, chylomicrons are present. Otherwise, the milkiness is caused by triglycerides. This is a qualitative judgment but is nevertheless useful, especially in equine patients.  Bilirubin level may also be appreciated by eye in most species. Equine and bovine plasma is normally yellow, which makes determination problematic, but in other species, any yellow color is abnormal and indicates an increased bilirubin level. Visual assessment of the depth and shade of color may provide additional information.  Other point-of-care tests include C-reactive protein as a marker for inflammation and cardiac troponin as a marker for cardiac muscle damage.  For emergency in-clinic use, the most important analytes beyond these simple basics are sodium and potassium. A dedicated ion-specific electrode meter is the best way to measure these. Instruments are available that can analyze whole blood, although great care must be taken to avoid artifacts due to unappreciated hemolysis. Critical care meters are also available that can estimate a variety of analytes, including glucose, urea, and electrolytes; however, these have not been extensively validated on nonhuman blood, and results should be interpreted with caution.  The Practice Laboratory: Extending in-practice analysis beyond these emergency basics requires a dedicated instrument capable of measuring multiple analytes. Two types are available—those based on transmission/absorbance photometry (wet chemistry) and those based on reflectance photometry (dry-reagent chemistry). Transmission/absorbance photometry is the reference method on which all reference values and interpretive guidelines are based. Reflectance photometry methods do not always compare well with the reference method and are best confined to simpler tests such as glucose and urea. For wider applications, such as enzyme analysis, wet chemistry instruments are preferred.  In-clinic analysis is inevitably more expensive than the same investigations done by a professional laboratory, and the range of analytes available is more restricted. Additionally, the level of accuracy or reliability is likely to be lower. Therefore, it is still best practice to regard in-practice analysis as an interim emergency investigation, with the results to be confirmed as appropriate by a professional laboratory. Detailed case laboratory evaluation of nonemergency patients is best referred to a professional laboratory from the outset, for reasons of cost, accuracy, range of analytes available, and the assistance of the clinical pathologist in interpretation of the results.  If in-clinic analysis is to be relied on for general case laboratory evaluation, meticulous attention must be paid to quality assurance. Samples of known composition must be run at least daily for each analyte, in both normal and pathologic ranges; unless these are within the tolerance limits, no patient samples should be tested. Participation in an external quality assessment program is also strongly recommended. Employing a trained technician will address some of these issues but has implications for availability of results during off hours and holidays. The veterinarian in charge of the laboratory is responsible for all the results issued and incurs a legal liability to prove accuracy and reliability. If these cannot be guaranteed to the same standard as a referral laboratory, then results should not be relied on without external confirmation. Cytology ByTrevor J.

This discussion is a brief guide to enable practitioners to prepare samples and undertake basic interpretation; it refers mostly to small animals, but the basic principles apply to all species.  Cytology should be considered a guide. Characteristics of the cells may not be sufficient in many instances to yield a definitive diagnosis or indicate the probable behavior of the lesion. These may require examination of the overall architecture of the tissue, for which cytology is not appropriate. If complex, expensive, or life-threatening therapy is being considered, then the diagnosis should if possible be confirmed by histology.  Techniques Full cytologic interpretation requires a good quality sample. A substantial minority of samples collected by practitioners are unsuitable for full interpretation. The technique appears to be simple, but consistently obtaining good-quality samples requires practice. If samples are sent to a laboratory for interpretation, sending more than one is recommended. In addition, staining and examining one of the preparations in-house helps to monitor the quality of the samples taken and make a provisional diagnosis. This requires a good staining technique and a good quality microscope with a range of objectives, including oil immersion.  Staining: The stains and techniques used for cytology preparations in a practice setting are the same as those used for hematology preparations. The traditional stains for cytology preparations are modified Wright stain (Wright-Giemsa) and May-Grunwald Giemsa. Over the past few years, good-quality rapid Romanowsky stains have been developed for cytology and hematology and are often used by veterinary diagnostic laboratories. Many different brands of rapid stain have been developed, so trying a number of products to see which stain is best suited to a practice is recommended. Poor preparations are not always the fault of the collection technique; the stain may be the problem. Stains deteriorate with use and require regular renewal. Many slides can be adjusted by returning a finished stained slide to the stain for deeper color reaction, or if overstained, can have some color removed by placing the slide in alcohol. Formalin-fixed cytology preparations must be stained with either H&E or Papanicolaou stain. If samples are sent to a laboratory for interpretation, the submission form should indicate whether formalin has been added.  Fine-needle Aspiration: The aim of fine-needle aspiration is to obtain a high cell harvest with minimal artifactual damage or blood contamination. The basic sampling kit consists of 21- and 25-gauge needles and 3-, 5-, and 10-mL syringes. Precise technique and choice of equipment depends on physical characteristics of the lesion and whether blood contamination is a problem.  The basic technique uses a 25-gauge needle and a 10-mL syringe. The needle is inserted into the lesion and repeatedly redirected to sample a number of areas while applying a small amount of suction on the syringe. Suction is released before withdrawing the needle. If suction is continued on withdrawal, the cell sample is violently sucked into the barrel of the syringe, causing cell rupture. Sample size is often very small and may be present only within the lumen of the needle and not in the syringe. When the sample has been obtained, the syringe is removed, filled with air, reattached, and used to gently express the sample onto a clean, dry, glass slide. Expressing the sample forcefully will rupture cells. Another slide is placed on top of the sample and pulled lengthways to spread the sample to a monolayer. Additional pressure should not be applied, because this also may cause rupture of the cells. Thicker areas are not a concern; the edges will often be thin enough to examine individual, nonoverlapping cells. The sample should be air dried as quickly as possible to reduce the effects of shrinkage; a hair dryer can be used for this purpose, but heating the sample must be avoided.  This technique can be adapted to different situations. If blood contamination is a problem, the size of the syringe and amount of suction can be reduced or the syringe removed altogether. This is particularly a problem with bone marrow aspiration but is common with all cytology samples and is thought to be due to excessive suction on the syringe. If blood contamination is unavoidable, the blood can be centrifuged. However, if the sample is directly smeared, a feathered edge should be examined, because this is where the heavier cells from the tissue tend to congregate. Blood contamination can often be decreased with the use of a very fine needle (25 gauge); this increases the chance of collecting enough cells for interpretation.  An alternative technique uses a needle without a syringe; no difference in the cell harvest between these two techniques has been shown. The needle is inserted without the syringe and repeatedly redirected to sample different depths and directions within the lesion. The cells are detached by the cutting edge of the needle and enter the needle lumen by capillary action. After withdrawal of the needle, a syringe containing air is reattached and used to gently express the sample. This technique is also particularly useful to sample fragile cells, such as lymphoid cells from lymph nodes. A far better cell harvest is obtained from splenic lesions with this technique than by applying suction. In addition, there is greater sensitivity in placement of the needle, which is especially useful for small lesions.  Certain tissues tend to give a very low cell harvest. These are usually composed of mesenchymal cells (connective tissue) that tightly adhere to each other and therefore do not exfoliate easily. For these lesions, a larger bore needle and increased suction may be necessary. However, a needle with a bore >21 gauge tends to provide a tissue core more suitable for histologic interpretation than cytology.  Impression Smears: Impression smears are often used for ulcerated surface lesions. They are of limited value, because they usually sample only the surface inflammatory exudate and rarely include cells from deeper tissues. A better use of this technique is at the time of biopsy to allow an immediate assessment of the lesion before fixation and processing of the tissue sample. The cut surface of the excised sample is blotted a number of times to remove surface blood and serum, and the dried surface is applied to a clean, dry slide with gentle pressure. A number of areas can be prepared on a single slide. The preparations should be quickly air dried and then stained.  Body Fluid Evaluation: Once a body fluid (eg, urine, pleural or peritoneal fluid) is obtained, a cytospin preparation is by far the best method of cell concentration. However, few practices have access to a cytospin, so centrifugation of the preparation and sampling of the centrifuged sediment is the usual method of cell concentration. Once the slide has been prepared, it should be rapidly air dried before staining.  If the fluid is to be sent to a laboratory, adding a few drops of formalin (the concentration is not critical) helps preserve cells and prevent bacterial overgrowth during transit. Severe bacterial overgrowth obscures the cells, and their metabolic products tend to destroy cells in cytology preparations. This is particularly useful for bronchoalveolar lavage samples and urine, which often contain infectious agents and are prone to bacterial contamination at sampling. The laboratory must be advised of the presence of formalin, which excludes the use of Romanowsky stains. Adding EDTA to help preserve cytology samples is often recommended, but the effect is minimal.  Cells in CSF samples degenerate very quickly and are usually present in very low numbers. Cytospin preparations are almost essential for CSF examination; this can usually be achieved only in a reference laboratory. The addition of a few drops of 10% formalin preserves the cells in CSF very well during transit.  Interpretation of Cytology Samples Cytology interpretation can be guided by an algorithm that also covers the common questions asked by clinicians. From a clinical viewpoint, it is often not necessary to complete all stages of this algorithm. For example, a simple differentiation of inflammation from neoplasia may be sufficient to allow a decision on the next stage of case management. Full cytology interpretation may require the services of a diagnostic laboratory, and a definitive diagnosis often requires histopathology. Some lesions cannot be definitively diagnosed by cytology. If in doubt or if the cytologic interpretation does not correlate with the clinical picture, histology is essential for full interpretation. Whenever the diagnosis is in doubt, biopsy is indicated.  Cytology algorithm   Cytology algorithm Algorithm to interpret cytology samples.  Inflammation: Recognition of basic inflammatory cells—neutrophils, eosinophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, and plasma cells—is essential for interpretation of cytology samples. Some tumors contain a large number of inflammatory cells, but these are very uncommon, even when there is tumor necrosis. The presence of only inflammatory cells in a sample usually indicates a primary inflammatory lesion. Ulceration produces inflammation on the surface of neoplastic lesions, but even in this case the inflammatory cells typically do not extend deeply into the underlying neoplasm. A small percentage of mast cell tumors, however, are composed almost entirely of inflammation, hemorrhage, and edema with only a small number of mast cells. These can be difficult to identify even by histology.  Neutrophils: These are the first cells to arrive in an area of inflammation, and they continue to be attracted to the site as long as the inflammatory stimulus lasts. Large numbers of neutrophils indicate acute inflammation and often are accompanied by smaller numbers of macrophages. This pattern is most often caused by infection or foreign body reaction, including furunculotic reactions directed against hair and keratin embedded in the soft tissue. If fluids are not examined immediately, bacteria, if present, will begin to proliferate, but phagocytosis of bacteria does not occur after sampling. Therefore, if the bacteria are truly pathogenic, they should be within the cytoplasm of the phagocytic cells. The cells’ cytoplasm may contain RBCs, tissue debris, or foreign material.  Macrophages: Macrophages arrive at a site of inflammation within 2–3 hr and are not necessarily an indicator of chronicity, although they often increase with time. They phagocytize bacteria and also larger structures, such as fungi, cellular debris, and foreign material. These cells are often associated with tissue destruction.  Macrophages come from circulating monocytes and have variable morphology. In the tissue, the cytoplasm greatly enlarges over time and usually becomes vacuolated. The nuclei become rounded. If a macrophage exhibits vacuolation or phagocytosis, it is often described as activated. They can be multinucleated, especially with foreign body reactions and in longstanding lesions. Under certain circumstances, they may become epithelioid. These cells have oval or round nuclei and small, often indistinct, nucleoli. Their cytoplasm is expanded but uniformly stained and not vacuolated. They can look epithelial, and great care must be taken when interpreting such cells. However, they do not normally form clusters, which is a key factor in differentiation from epithelial cells.  Macrophages are almost always seen in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (they come from the alveoli) and body cavity fluids (part of the modification process), joints (a normal component but increased in disease), and cyst contents (a nonspecific reaction).  Eosinophils: Eosinophils have segmented nuclei and eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. They vary slightly between species and are generally slightly larger than neutrophils. In cytology preparations, it can occasionally be difficult to distinguish poorly stained eosinophils from neutrophils, because the granules can become indistinct and the cytoplasm of degenerating neutrophils become more acidic, giving a more eosinophilic staining reaction. They are often seen in association with mast cells. Eosinophils are associated with allergies and also are prominent in parasitic diseases, superficial cutaneous viral infection in cats, and fungal infections. They are the predominant cell type in specific eosinophilic conditions such as eosinophilic granuloma in cats (rarely in dogs), canine eosinophilic folliculitis and furunculosis, and eosinophilic collagenolytic granuloma in horses. Some cases of canine cutaneous mast cell tumors have a very high proportion of eosinophils and very few mast cells (<5% of cases).  Of the most commonly encountered veterinary species, rabbits and guinea pigs have inflammatory cells equivalent to neutrophils in other species, but have eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. These are called heterophils. They can be difficult to distinguish from eosinophils. The cellular equivalent to neutrophils in birds and reptiles are also heterophils with eosinophilic granules.  Lymphocytes: Lymphocytes are usually small with very little cytoplasm and smudged chromatin with no nucleoli. The almost-round nuclei are similar in size to those of red cells. RBCs are often present in cytology preparations, where they can be used as a comparative and absolute scale. RBCs vary slightly with species; in dogs, RBCs are ~7 microns in diameter. Medium and large lymphocytes, which have a slightly more open chromatin pattern and more cytoplasm, can also be seen in inflammatory processes. Along with plasma cells, lymphocytes are part of the chronic inflammatory response and tend to arrive in tissue a few days after the acute inflammation has begun. However, they are not specific for a particular stimulus and are mostly small lymphocytes. If mostly medium to large cells are present, lymphoma is a possibility. However, even large lymphoblastic cells can be seen in low numbers in inflammatory processes. Normal and reactive lymphocytes in body fluids often appear larger than the same cells from soft tissue.  Multinucleated Cells: These cells are large and have larger numbers of nuclei with one to three small nucleoli and vacuolated cytoplasm. They develop from macrophages (see above) and tend to appear late in the course of inflammation. The cytoplasm should be examined for the presence of fungal organisms and for foreign material. These cells are usually seen in small numbers mixed with other inflammatory cells as part of a granulomatous reaction. Multinucleated cells are much less specific in birds and reptiles, in which they are common in many focal inflammatory lesions, irrespective of cause, and can appear quite early in the inflammatory process.  Fibroblasts: Fibroblasts are not inflammatory cells, but they are frequently seen in association with inflammation. They will proliferate as part of the repair reaction associated with any tissue damage and appear in an inflammatory lesion after ~2 days. Classically, fibroblasts and fibrocytes are elongated cells with pointed tails of cytoplasm. They have round or oval nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, and moderate amounts of uniform, pale blue-staining cytoplasm. The cytoplasmic boundaries are indistinct, giving a “wispy” appearance. When fibroblasts are aspirated from tissue, the cells often become round and lose their spindle shape, but a small number, especially cells in groups, retain their elongated shape. Reactive fibroblasts cannot be definitively distinguished cytologically from low-grade spindle cell tumors. If found in association with inflammatory cells, spindle cells are most often reactive. If found in large clumps with no apparent stimulus, they are more often neoplastic (but neoplasia cannot be excluded). Because fibroblasts and fibrocytes are the principal connective tissue cell, they are tightly adherent to each other, and cell harvest tends to be low.  Neoplasia: Inflammatory lesions are characterized by cells from different populations. The presence of cells that are predominantly of the same population indicates normal tissue, hyperplasia, or neoplasia. Ideally, the first stage in evaluation of a cytologic sample for neoplasia is to determine the tissue type from which the cells have come. If this is not possible, it is necessary to simply determine the likely behavior of the cells. This can often be done without specifically identifying the cell type. The following checklist includes features that can be examined to determine tissue type and likely behavior of the lesion: 1) cell numbers, 2) cell distribution within the smear, 3) cell shape, 4) nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, 5) pleomorphism (both nuclear and cytoplasmic), 6) number, shape, and size of nucleoli, and 7) cytoplasmic content such as melanin, metachromatic granules, fat, etc. Classification of the cell type and likely behavior may require a tissue biopsy. With few exceptions, histology will be necessary for a definitive diagnosis and is always necessary to assess mitotic index and to grade a tumor.  There are three basic tissue types: epithelial, mesenchymal (supporting or connective tissue), and round cells.  Epithelial Cells: Mammary carcinoma, dog   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Epithelial cells are round, cuboidal, or polygonal and tend to adhere tightly to each other and exfoliate in clusters or sheets. They have a sharp cytoplasmic outline and exfoliate in moderate numbers. Cells with more than one nucleus are uncommon.  Mesenchymal Cells: Mesenchymal, or spindle, cells   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Mesenchymal cells are tightly adherent and usually exfoliate in low numbers as single cells or small aggregates. They are classically spindle shaped but usually round up and become plump when removed from the body, particularly when they are lying singly within the smear. The spindle shape is often more apparent in small aggregates. They tend to appear “wispy” because of indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries. Binucleate cells are not uncommon.  Round Cells: Round cells (plasmacytoma)   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Round cells have little or no adherence in the body. They typically exfoliate in large numbers and lie individually in the smear without clumping. Cells of this category include mast cells, lymphocytes, histiocytes, plasma cells, and cells of transmissible venereal tumors.  Tumor Evaluation: To distinguish benign from malignant tumors, the amount of variation in certain characteristics within the cell population must be assessed. In general, the more malignant the cell, the less differentiated it becomes and the more variation there is in the cell morphology. Benign tumors have cells that are often uniform in size with a uniform nucleus:cytoplasm ratio; they strongly resemble or are identical to the cell of origin. The more malignant the cells become, the more variation is seen in these criteria. Nuclear criteria are the major indicators of malignancy.  Criteria for malignancy include the following: variation in cell size and shape, increased cell exfoliation, increased nuclear size, increased nucleus:cytoplasm ratio, variation in nuclear size and an increase in multinucleated cells, increased mitosis with abnormal mitotic figures, a coarse and often clumped chromatin pattern, altered shape of the nucleus due to close approximation of a nucleus from an adjacent cell (nuclear moulding), and large and often multiple nucleoli of irregular and abnormal shape. There are a number of exceptions to these indicators; in such situations, histology is essential for full interpretation.  The following are some exceptions to the rules of interpretation:  Thyroid carcinomas usually have fairly uniform, well-differentiated cells. A diagnosis of carcinoma can be made simply on the size of the mass in dogs (tumors >3 cm are automatically considered malignant) but not in cats. Major features of malignancy, such as capsular, soft-tissue invasion and vessel invasion, can only be identified histologically. Other tissues in which it may be impossible to differentiate benign from malignant cells include apocrine gland carcinomas, basal cell tumors, melanomas, and proliferative lesions of the liver.  Unlike most malignant tumors, lymphoma is commonly characterized by a uniform population of cells that are larger than normal lymphoid cells. Therefore, variation in morphology is not necessary for a diagnosis of malignancy with this tissue type. If there is marked variation and small lymphocytes are present, then that is more typical of hyperplasia.  Some normal structures, such as hepatoid glands, have more than one cell type (reserve and terminal cells) and can therefore show variation in morphology, and benign tumors of hepatoid glands can have a similar mixture. Nuclear morphology, however, maintains benign features.  Many mammary tumors can show marked variation in cell morphology but histologically would be classified as benign. Indicators of mammary tumor behavior are architectural features, such as local tissue invasion and invasion of vessels. These cannot be assessed using cytology. These exceptions often make cytologic interpretation unreliable, particularly for these types of tissues.  Most spindle cell tumors do not metastasize but are locally aggressive and often difficult to remove. The criteria for malignancy are often less important with respect to the behavior of these tumors than for the epithelial tumors.  Common Cytology Results: Some specific features of cytology preparations can provide a more accurate interpretation of the sample. Listed below are some common results and their interpretation.  Mature Fat Cells: Fat cells, typical balloon-like, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Fat cells, folded and overlapping, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Mature fat cells are seen in benign lipomas and mature body fat. It is not possible to differentiate these cytologically. Fat cells are mesenchymal cells, and because they tend not to exfoliate well, they are usually present in low numbers. If a sample has come from the center of a nodular mass, fat cells are diagnostic for lipoma. These clear-staining, balloon-like cells are often in clusters, folded, and overlapping.  Spindle Cells: It is usually not possible to differentiate reactive spindle cells from those of spindle cell neoplasia. Indicators of neoplasia include absence of a reactive stimulus, such as inflammation or hemorrhage, and a higher cell population with more numerous and larger clumps of cells. Greater variation in cell morphology indicates more aggressive behavior. When removed from their tissue, they often round up and can be mistaken for round cells, but there are usually some distinctly spindle cells in most preparations.  Keratin: Keratin, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Keratin clump, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Keratin includes nucleated and terminally differentiated non-nucleated squamous epithelial cells. Keratin can be a contaminant from the surface of the skin of the animal or the skin of all handlers of the sample and is a common artifact. It can also be sampled from cutaneous keratin-filled cysts, which are always benign and very common, particularly in dog skin. Large, densely packed clumps of keratin in restricted areas in the center of the slide suggest that keratin is not an artifact but has been sampled from the lesion.  Blood: Blood is a common artifact of fine-needle aspiration but can also come from blood-filled spaces in tissue. These can be non-neoplastic, such as hematomas, aneurysms, or severe bruising, or neoplastic lesions such as hemangiomas and hemangiosarcomas. The presence of spindle cells does not adequately differentiate neoplastic from non-neoplastic causes of hemorrhage ( see Tumor Evaluation:). Spindle cells produce the neoplastic blood vessels in hemangiosarcomas, but especially in young dogs, they can occasionally produce a very cellular capsule to a soft-tissue hematoma. The capsule contains very active fibroblasts, but they are not neoplastic. Blood that has come directly from the vascular system normally contains significant numbers of platelets. Using a 25-gauge needle can help decrease blood contamination. Blood is almost always seen in aspiration from parenchymatous organs, such as the liver, spleen, kidneys, and bone marrow.  No Cells: Lack of cells is a common problem of fine-needle aspiration. If the technique is practiced properly, absence of cells can indicate mesenchymal cell proliferation (including lipomas), because these structural cells within the body are tightly adherent cells that do not exfoliate well.  Cells with Cytoplasmic Granules: The most important type among cells with cytoplasmic granules is the mast cell, given that mast cell tumors are common in dogs. These are medium-sized cells with round nuclei. With Romanowsky stains, the granules are dark blue or purple, small (about the size of bacteria), and usually found in large numbers in the cytoplasm. Less-differentiated mast cells have fewer granules. Cytology cannot be used to grade mast cell tumors; grading always requires histology, because it does not depend on only cell morphology. The cells are fragile, and often there are large numbers of granules in the background that have been released from damaged cells. In dogs, eosinophils are often present and very occasionally can be the dominant cell type; however, they are less common in other species. Mast cell tumors in horses have similar cytology to those in dogs, but in cats the cells in mast cell tumors are often smaller, more uniform, and have less distinct granulation.  Thyroid cells can also have dark granules, usually blue or black. These tyrosine granules are very small, low in number, and can be difficult to see. Larger black granules are associated with melanomas. Cytology cannot differentiate benign from malignant melanomas; however, melanomas on haired skin in dogs are usually benign and those on nonhaired areas, such as the lips, feet, and mouth, are usually malignant. Basal cell tumors also often contain cells with melanin, especially in cats. These tumors are usually benign and cytologically can sometimes be difficult to distinguish from melanomas. Melanin can also be seen in macrophages (melanophages), sometimes in large amounts, but it is usually in much larger clumps within the cytoplasm rather than fine granules that are seen in melanocytes. Very fine magenta granules can sometimes be seen in osteoblastic cells from osteosarcoma. Golden, granular material accumulates in the cytoplasm of macrophages when there has been hemorrhage into soft tissue (hemosiderophages). Liver cells can sometimes contain bile, which stains very dark, and occasionally long, thin strands of dark material can be seen where canaliculi have become filled with bile.  Cells with Cytoplasmic Vacuoles: A large, single vacuole is seen in fat cells. In normal or benign cells, the nuclei are small and often indistinct, and the cells are often folded like a collapsed ball. Smaller cells with larger, more prominent nuclei and some cytoplasm in addition to clear, often small vacuoles are more suggestive of malignancy.  Cells with multiple, small vacuoles with a foamy appearance include macrophages, sebaceous glandular cells, and salivary cells. It can be very difficult to differentiate these; the site and other clinical features can be a deciding factor in interpretation.  Differentiation of Round Cell Tumors: Round cell tumors include mast cells, plasma cells, lymphocytes, histiocytic cells, and transmissible venereal tumor cells. Mast cells have distinctive granules within the cytoplasm and are usually easily identified; if they are the dominant cell type, this is diagnostic for a mast cell tumor. In rare cases, mast cells can have few or no granules in the cytoplasm. Lymphoid cells classically have a very high nucleus:cytoplasm ratio; few other cells have this feature. Neoplastic, lymphoid cells are medium size to large, with a nucleus at least 1.5 times the size of an erythrocyte. Nucleoli are often multiple, sometimes quite prominent. However, the rare cases of small-cell lymphoma have cells indistinguishable from normal lymphocytes.  Cells of a histiocytoma (Langerhans cells) are not especially histiocytic cytologically. They are round cells with a small to moderate amount of pale-staining cytoplasm. They are fairly uniform and have nuclei that are eccentric within the cell. Nucleoli are indistinct. True histiocytic cells are slightly more problematic to interpret. These are part of the cell line that includes the antigen-presenting cells, such as macrophages and Langerhans cells, but can range from inflammatory and reactive cells to highly malignant round cell tumors. They tend to be larger than the other round cells with more cytoplasm, sometimes are vacuolated, and can have oval or indented nuclei. Infiltrates of histiocytic cells are often problematic, even with a full-tissue biopsy examination, and always require histologic examination to assess behavior.  Histiocytoma, cytology   Image Courtesy of Abbey Veterinary Services.  Neoplastic plasma cells include cells of myeloma. These are usually well differentiated and have most of the characteristics of normal plasma cells. When neoplastic, they are found in large numbers with few other cell types present. Benign nodular proliferations of plasma cells, plasmacytomas, show more marked pleomorphism and often differ markedly from normal plasma cells. Many have a slightly histiocytic appearance, and these can be difficult to distinguish cytologically. These cells have a round nucleus and a coarse chromatin pattern, which sometimes becomes clumped around the nuclear membrane. The nucleus is often eccentric with an intensely basophilic cytoplasm and paranuclear pale Golgi zone.  Cells of transmissible venereal tumors tend to have a moderate amount of cytoplasm (more than found in lymphoblasts), often with small vacuoles. Nuclear chromatin is coarse, with one or two fairly prominent nucleoli. Mitotic figures are often numerous. Unlike most cytology preparations of neoplastic lesions, they tend to have moderate variation in the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio.  Cytology of Specific Sites: Lymph Nodes: Normal, hyperplastic, and early neoplastic lymph nodes have a mixed population of cells. Cells are predominantly small lymphocytes with variable numbers of medium and large lymphoid cells and some plasma cells. A uniform population of cells indicates neoplasia. Lymph node aspirates often have a population of cells that are much paler staining and larger, with some cells completely losing their cytoplasm. These cells are in varying stages of degeneration and should be ignored. Size in comparison with RBCs is useful. Normal mature lymphocytes or small neoplastic lymphocytes (rare) have nuclei the same size as RBCs. However, neoplastic lymphoid cells have nuclei at least 1.5 times the diameter of RBCs. Lymphomatous lymph nodes may still contain a significant number of normal lymphoid cells. The proportion of smaller mature lymphocytes must then be compared with the larger immature cells to differentiate hyperplasia from neoplasia. The proportion considered significant varies, but in general, most cytologists consider a diagnosis of lymphoma when immature cells are >50% of the cell population. Some cytologists require a higher percentage of immature cells, particularly if there is only one lymph node enlarged. If there is doubt, a biopsy should be performed. Histopathologic confirmation of diagnosis is essential if therapy for lymphoma is considered and is always needed for full grading.  Submandibular lymph nodes are often difficult to assess. They drain the buccal and nasal areas and are subject to strong antigenic stimuli. They frequently undergo hyperplasia, often histologically atypical, especially in cats. Cats also develop unusual neoplastic conditions affecting this node, such as the T cell–rich B-cell lymphoma and Hodgkin-like lymphoma, both of which have a majority of normal lymph node cells. For these reasons, great care must be taken in the interpretation of lesions involving the submandibular lymph nodes, because false-negative and false-positive results for neoplasia are not uncommon.  Aspirates from suspected enlarged submandibular lymph nodes often yield only large foamy cells, which are salivary cells. This result can be due either to sampling error or to hypertrophy of the salivary gland in cases of sialoadenosis. The cause of sialoadenosis is not understood, but a significant minority of submandibular aspirates contain only these cells.  Body Cavity Fluids: Meaningful analysis of fluids from body cavities requires total protein (measured with a handheld refractometer), total cell count, and a differential of cell types present ( see Table: Characteristics of Transudates and Exudate). Pure transudates are rare, because they rapidly become modified by leakage of fluid from lymphatics or blood vessels and attraction of mixed inflammatory cells. Transudates attract activated macrophages with varying numbers of nondegenerate neutrophils. The lymphocytes that may also be present are classified as small, but most look slightly larger than circulating lymphocytes and are part of the reactive process of the fluid in the body cavity. In addition, when fluid accumulates in the body cavity, the lining mesothelial cells proliferate and are shed into the fluid. These cells are large, often multinucleated, vary in appearance, and often are seen in groups with large nucleoli. They sometimes form grape-like clusters with a narrow, pale space between the cells. These features are usually considered to be associated with malignancy, but in this case, the cells are simply reactive and not neoplastic. Care must be taken to differentiate these mesothelial cells from neoplastic cells within the body fluid. A small number of these cells typically have a corona around the cytoplasmic envelope (giving a fuzzy outline); this is a distinguishing feature of mesothelial cells.  Table Characteristics of Transudates and Exudate Mesothelial cells can be present in very large numbers, especially in pericardial fluid. Malignant mesotheliomas are rare in domestic species, but it is not possible to differentiate neoplastic from reactive mesothelial cells on cytologic examination. The degree of polyploidy is not a distinguishing feature.  Mixed inflammatory cells increase in number as a transudate becomes modified and are present in large numbers in an exudate. Mesothelial cells would be expected in this type of sample, and it can therefore be useful to look for a second population when checking for neoplasia. Smoothly demarcated aggregates of atypical cells with no narrow spaces between the cells may indicate a second population of carcinoma cells.  Tracheal or Bronchoalveolar Lavage (BAL): Respiratory epithelial cells are seen in BAL from healthy and diseased animals. The epithelial cells may retain their original structure with a ciliated surface and basal nuclei, but they often appear round with indistinct cilia.  Macrophages are usually the dominant inflammatory cell type in BAL from healthy animals. These come from deep in the alveoli and are part of the normal defense mechanisms. They greatly increase with fluid accumulation in the lung (eg, cardiovascular insufficiency) and in inflammatory conditions, where they are accompanied by other inflammatory cells. Debris, foreign material, hemosiderin, RBCs, and microorganisms can sometimes be seen in the cytoplasm of these cells. Macrophages containing hemosiderin in people are called heart failure cells, but their cause is less specific in domestic species. There are increased numbers of macrophages in many subacute and chronic lung disorders.  In healthy dogs and cats, neutrophils contribute <5% of cells in BAL preparations. Neutrophils are nonspecific inflammatory cells in the respiratory system and do not necessarily indicate infection. They can be the most numerous cells in an inflammatory reaction, even in cases of allergy. However, when neutrophils are present, the cytoplasm should always be examined carefully for the presence of any infectious agent. Bacteria can also sometimes be seen in the extracellular parts of the smear, but extracellular bacteria are often contaminants from the pharynx.  Great care must be taken to differentiate eosinophils from neutrophils in BAL preparations because the granules are often faint and difficult to identify. Eosinophils can comprise up to 5% of cells in BAL from healthy dogs but may reach 10% in healthy cats. Eosinophils that comprise >10% of cells indicate an allergic respiratory disease, although lungworms and heartworms can also cause this reaction. With lungworm infestation, larvae are sometimes present as large coiled structures.  Nucleated and nonnucleated squamous cells are commonly seen in BAL preparations and are often associated with bacteria on the cell surface. This indicates contamination from the pharynx. Bacteria are normal inhabitants of the pharynx, in particular Simonsiella, which are very large, ladder-like organisms. Their presence confirms contamination from the pharynx. If bacteria are present along with squamous epithelial cells, it may not be possible to conclude whether the bacteria are from the respiratory tree or the pharynx. Bacteria in the cytoplasm of neutrophils confirms a significant infection.  Synovial Fluid: Full examination of synovial fluid should include protein content, mucin clot formation, viscosity, cell count and differential, and direct cytologic examination. It is usually not feasible to perform all of these tests in a practice setting, but cytologic examination and physical examination can usually give a good estimate of the results of most of these tests. Cytology, therefore, is the most useful single test in synovial fluid examination.  Sampling technique requires the following equipment: a 3-mL syringe, a 21- or 25-gauge needle, clean glass slides, and various collection tubes (plain, EDTA, and heparin). This technique always requires a degree of sedation, and a sterile technique is essential. Each joint has a recommended site for aspiration (beyond the scope of this discussion) and generally requires slight flexion or hyperextension. The needle attached to the syringe is slowly advanced into the joint space and, taking care not to scratch the articular surface, gentle suction is applied. Normal joint fluid is viscous and sticky and of small volume. The volume of fluid, however, depends on the size of the animal, the joint sampled, and the degree of effusion into the joint. When sample size is sufficient, it is essential to release the suction on the syringe before withdrawing the needle.  Sample handling is critical; because many tests can be performed on synovial fluid, and cytology is the most important, sometimes the sample volume is so small that no other test is possible. Therefore, a plain smear should always be made and quickly air dried as soon as the sample is obtained. Most tests can be performed on samples without anticoagulant (a plain red-topped tube), or the sample can be left in the sampling syringe. However, blood contamination, hemarthrosis, and inflammatory effusion introduce fibrin into the joint, and the sample may clot. Placing part of the sample into an EDTA tube can prevent this, but EDTA can interfere in the mucin clot test and, for this reason, a heparinized sample may also be necessary.  Results of cytology preparations can indicate the number of cells present, the type of cell and the differential, the presence of tumor cells, and the presence of bacteria. They can also give an indication of viscosity. In fluid of normal or increased viscosity, cells tend to align in rows in the direction of the smearing; this is described as windrowing.  In healthy animals, cell counts vary widely (eg, 0–4,400/mL in dogs), but they are usually very low. Counts >500/mL in dogs generally indicate a significant increase. Normal synovial fluid contains ~2 cells/high-powered field (400X magnification). In the vast majority of cases where there is an increased cell content, cell numbers are either low (up to 4 or 5 cells/high-powered field) in degenerative joint disease or very high in septic or autoimmune arthritis. Intermediate equivocal results are extremely uncommon.  Cell types include joint mononuclear cells, which are a mixture of circulating monocytes, tissue macrophages, and synovial lining cells. It is not possible, or even necessary, to differentiate these cells, because they all have a similar morphology and all react to similar stimuli. Cytoplasmic vacuolation of these cells, and especially the presence of phagocytosis of debris or RBCs, indicate activation, a feature not seen in normal joint mononuclear cells. In degenerative joint disease, synovial fluid usually contains only macrophages, occasionally with extremely low numbers of neutrophils.  Hemorrhage is common in synovial preparations but is frequently an artifact. True hemarthrosis provides a synovial fluid sample that is uniformly contaminated with blood at the time of sampling. If the blood contamination occurs at the very end of the sampling procedure with clear fluid initially, this is most likely artifact. In addition, in true hemarthrosis, RBCs may be seen in the cytoplasm of macrophages. Artifactual blood contamination will also introduce WBCs, such as neutrophils, making interpretation of inflammatory cells in the sample difficult, although blood contamination still gives only a low cell number.  Neutrophils are present in large numbers in both septic arthritis and autoimmune joint disease. These two conditions can usually be differentiated by the clinical history. In septic arthritis, bacteria are sometimes found within the cytoplasm of phagocytic cells. The absence of bacteria, either within cytology preparations or by culture, does not exclude bacteria as a cause of arthritis. False-negative results for bacteria are not uncommon.  Lymphocytes are often present in very small numbers in inflammatory processes but are not specific for a particular cause.  Osteoclasts are very occasionally seen when there has been erosion of the articular cartilage with exposure of the underlying bone.  Neoplastic cells in joint fluid are rare, although joints can be the site of both primary and secondary tumors.  Macrophages increase with any damage to a joint, especially in cases of degenerative joint disease. Cytoplasmic vacuolation of these cells, and especially the presence of phagocytosis of debris or RBCs, indicate macrophage activation, a feature not seen in normal joint mononuclear cells. In degenerative joint disease, synovial fluid often contains only macrophages.  Nasal Cavity: The cytology of nasal flush preparations is similar to that seen with BAL preparations. A small number of respiratory epithelial cells are usually flushed out along with exudate. A predominance of eosinophils may indicate inhaled allergens, parasites, or fungi and may occasionally indicate bacteria or neoplasia. The presence of eosinophils in the nasal cavity therefore is less indicative of a specific process than in some other sites, eg, the trachea or bronchi.  Neutrophils are the most common exudative cell but, as with BAL, often indicate secondary infection. In the case of intranasal neoplasia, cells with neoplastic characteristics ( see Neoplasia:) may be present, but absence of these cells does not exclude neoplasia. Only a minority of neoplastic processes erode the overlying respiratory epithelium and allow exfoliation of neoplastic cells.  Similarly, absence of fungal hyphae within the preparation does not exclude fungal infection. Unless fungal plaques are sampled directly for both cytology and culture, false-negative results are common. Viral inclusions are rarely seen.  Vaginal Cytology: This can be used to identify the various stages of the canine estrous cycle, but results must be interpreted in conjunction with the animal’s behavior. A sample of exfoliated cells is obtained from the vaginal vault cranial to the urethral orifice with a cotton-tipped swab or glass rod. Cells are gently rolled onto a glass slide, air dried, and stained. Features to be identified include neutrophils, bacteria, RBCs, and the types of epithelial cells. Epithelial cells (in increasing order of differentiation) are parabasal, small and large intermediate cells, and superficial cells. Parabasal cells are small, with central round nuclei, indistinct nucleoli, a relatively narrow band of cytoplasm, and a nucleus:cytoplasm ratio of ~1:1. Small intermediate cells have a similar nucleus but a much larger amount of cytoplasm. Large intermediate cells have a similar nucleus with very large amounts of cytoplasm and an angular, irregular outline. Superficial cells also have large amounts of cytoplasm, but their nuclei are pyknotic (small and contracted) or absent.  The stages of the estrous cycle change gradually. If a preparation does not conform exactly to a specific part of the cycle, judgment must be made regarding what stages are present. In proestrus, all types of epithelial cells are present along with neutrophils, RBCs, and mucus. As proestrus progresses, the epithelial cells increasingly approach terminal differentiation (superficial cells), and neutrophils slowly decrease. Bacteria are often present in large numbers. In estrus, >90% of epithelial cells are superficial cells, with no background mucus. There are large numbers of bacteria, but no neutrophils. In diestrus, parabasal and intermediate cells are >80% of the total epithelial cells. Variable numbers of neutrophils and bacteria are present but usually fewer than in proestrus. It can be difficult to differentiate some stages of proestrus from diestrus. In anestrus, parabasal and intermediate cells predominate. Neutrophils and bacteria are rare. RBCs do not help differentiate the stages of estrus.  Cerebrospinal Fluid: Interpretation of CSF cytology is difficult, because it can be hard to obtain enough well-preserved cells for examination before the sample deteriorates. Cell counts in normal CSF are low (0–5 cells/μL in dogs and 0–8 cells/μL in cats). However, there is a large variation in cell counts between individuals; counts can also vary between cysternal and lumbar taps in the same individual. Because the albumin level of CSF is ~20% of that found in serum, the cells that are present rapidly degenerate. Cell counts should ideally be done and morphology examined within 1 hr of collection.  Because of the low cell numbers, the use of an automated cell counter is usually not appropriate. A hemocytometer can be used for cell counts, and a cytocentrifuge for cytology preparations. A simplified sedimentation technique (description of which is beyond the scope of this discussion) to concentrate cells onto a slide is suitable for practice use. The presence of more than one or two nucleated cells in a plain smear of CSF should be considered potentially significant.  In CSF, an increase in nucleated cells is called pleocytosis. There is tremendous variation and overlap in both the degree of pleocytosis and the types of cells present in both infectious and noninfectious conditions in the CNS. Interpretation should be integrated with the other clinical details of the case. If neutrophils and/or macrophages are present, the cytoplasm of the cells should be searched for bacteria and fungi. The absence of organisms or pleocytosis does not exclude infection, and noninfectious conditions in the CNS can also produce a neutrophilic pleocytosis.  Apart from lymphoma, it is rare to find neoplastic cells in CSF. If noninflammatory cells are present in the CSF, they should be interpreted using the basic principles detailed above.  Urine Cytology: Urine can be examined as a wet preparation or as a dried cytology smear. Because of the absence of staining in a wet preparation, these are better limited to examination for crystals and RBCs. Although nucleated cells may be seen, in most cases they cannot be identified and are better examined using a dried cytology smear.  There are at least 10 common forms of urinary crystals. Identification is not discussed here but may be readily accomplished by use of good reference illustrations. (Also see Urolithiasis in Small Animals.)  Because cells in urine rapidly degenerate, particularly if bacteria are present, centrifuged preparations of urine samples should be examined rapidly after sampling. If this is not possible, boric acid is often added to urine to prevent degeneration and bacterial overgrowth, although its effect may be very limited. If a delay between sampling and examination is likely, a better preservation method is the addition of a few drops of formalin; however,the traditional Romanowsky stains cannot then be used. H&E stain is a better alternative for formalin-fixed samples.  Normal urine usually has very few nucleated cells. Single urothelial cells are occasionally present. Squamous epithelial cells are also seen in urine and come from the terminal urethra, vagina, vulva, and preputial epithelium. Squamous metaplasia of bladder epithelium after chronic inflammation is very rare.  Neoplastic cells in urine samples are almost always epithelial. They are rounded polygonal cells, often clumped, with marked variation in morphology, especially the nucleus:cytoplasm ratio. Uniform cells are more likely to be normal. Mildly pleomorphic cells can be associated with hyperplasia (eg, some cases of polypoid cystitis).  The inflammatory cells seen in cystitis are almost exclusively neutrophils. Eosinophils are seen in some rare, specific inflammatory conditions, but macrophages are very uncommon even in chronic conditions. By far the most common cause of inflammation is infection, so the cytoplasm of the neutrophils should be examined carefully for bacteria. It is very uncommon to see a significant neutrophil component accompanying neoplasia or calculi.  RBCs are commonly seen with neoplastic and inflammatory diseases of the bladder but are also often seen without an indication of other pathology. This can be a sampling artifact but is also a common finding in cases of interstitial cystitis. In cats, this term is often used synonymously with feline urologic syndrome, but interstitial cystitis also is seen in dogs and people, suggesting other unknown pathogenic factors that can cause this condition. Persistent hematuria without cytologic evidence of neoplasia or inflammation may indicate interstitial cystitis.  Also see Urinalysis.  Liver Cytology: Although cytology is a popular method to investigate liver disease, there is disagreement on its usefulness. Blood contamination is found in most samples and may overshadow inflammatory infiltrates by introducing circulating WBCs. Diagnosis of many hepatic diseases relies on architectural features and the distribution of the changes within the liver rather than on the morphology of individual cells. Finally, in some hepatic disorders, hepatocytes proliferate without significant changes in their individual morphology (see below). These factors limit the amount of information that can be obtained from cytology of liver tissue.  Sampling methods are similar to those used for other organs. Sampling is usually performed under guidance of ultrasound, but blind sampling can be performed at the tenth intercostal space at the level of the connection of rib to rib cartilage. Bleeding during this procedure is not a significant risk.  In the healthy liver, hepatocytes are plump, polygonal rounded cells with a diameter of 25–30 microns. Nuclei are central and round with a single large, prominent nucleolus. A few cells are binucleated. There is a large amount of blue-staining cytoplasm that usually appears granular.  Changes in the metabolism of liver cells can be seen within the cytoplasm. The presence of numerous small, discrete vacuoles or one large vacuole indicates accumulation of fat. This has several potential causes and is prominent in feline hepatic lipidosis syndrome, starvation, pregnancy, and diabetes mellitus. Enlarged hepatocytes with a pale granular-staining cytoplasm but no discrete vacuoles are characteristic of excess glycogen storage. This is most often caused by increased levels of circulating steroids.  Bile stasis and pigment accumulation (eg, iron) can also be assessed by examination of the cytoplasm. Hepatocytes normally accumulate lipofuscin pigment, noted as small, fairly uniform, dark-staining granules, whereas bile and often hemosiderin tend to appear as slightly larger dark-staining bodies within the cytoplasm. Bile accumulation within the canaliculae (canalicular plugs) can also occasionally be seen. These appear as black ribbons on the surface of hepatocytes.  Cytologic interpretation of inflammation is difficult because of the inevitable blood contamination of samples. Inflammation should be considered significant only if it is present within clusters of hepatocytes. Although the individual inflammatory cells can be recognized, it is not possible to indicate which part of the liver is principally affected. Neutrophils can be seen in diffuse hepatitis and also in more focal cholangitis. Small, mature inflammatory lymphocytes are usually seen in periportal inflammatory conditions, such as lymphocytic pericholangitis in cats and chronic active hepatitis in dogs. Macrophages can also be seen in the chronic inflammatory conditions and also in certain infections. Phagocytic cells should be investigated for the presence of organisms within the cytoplasm, but this is uncommon in liver disease.  Primary proliferative nodular hepatocellular lesions include regenerative hyperplasia, nodular hyperplasia, adenoma (hepatoma), and hepatocellular carcinoma. Biliary proliferations can appear as cysts, adenomas, or carcinomas. Bile duct cells tend to be smaller than hepatocytes with less cytoplasm. They are cuboidal or low columnar cells that occasionally produce tubular structures within cytology samples. The cytoplasm is also more uniformly pale staining and not significantly granular. Nucleoli are smaller and less distinct. Significant cell harvest from cystic bile ducts is uncommon because most of these lesions are simply cystic space rather than cellular. If a significant number of biliary epithelial cells are obtained, neoplasia is most likely. However, malignant bile duct cells are more commonly uniform in size and shape and, therefore, do not always show the morphologic features usually associated with malignancy.  Hepatocellular proliferation is a difficult area of interpretation, because hepatocytes in benign proliferative lesions are very similar to those in well-differentiated carcinomas and indeed often cannot be differentiated even from normal hepatocytes. Only in cases with poorly differentiated pleomorphic cells can an adequate interpretation of malignancy be made. The benign and non-neoplastic proliferations always have the same morphology as normal hepatocytes. Therefore, false-negative results for proliferative lesions within the liver are common. Cytology is thus of limited value for nodular hepatocellular lesions.  Cytology can be a useful technique for diagnosis of round cell tumors in the liver. Even with severe inflammatory lesions, lymphocytes are present in low numbers and are generally small, mature lymphocytes. A large population of medium and large lymphoid cells indicates lymphoma. No other condition will give this result.  The other common round cell tumor that can affect the liver (particularly in cats but also occasionally in dogs) is mast cell tumor. The granules within mast cells are metachromatic, facilitating diagnosis. Aspirates of normal liver may contain a few mast cells, but in neoplasia they are usually present in large numbers. If other cells are obtained from cytology preparations, they should be interpreted using the principles described above.  Kidney Cytology: Normal renal aspirates have almost a pure population of renal tubular cells. These are uniform, medium-sized cells of ~17–20 microns with central nuclei, small indistinct nucleoli, and a moderate amount of pale-staining cytoplasm. In cats, lipid droplets within the cytoplasm are a common, normal feature. The cells can be present either singly or in clusters and can occasionally be seen as tubular structures. They sometimes contain small, dark granules within the cytoplasm.  Renal lymphoma is the most common neoplastic disease of the kidney in cats and dogs. Because the cells are usually widely distributed within the tissue, false-negative results with cytologic examination are uncommon. Diagnosis can be made using the criteria described above. Primary renal tumors are uncommon.  Cystic lesions include renal cysts, most commonly seen in cats but also occasionally in dogs, and hydronephrosis. In both disorders, cell harvest is usually low, with a large amount of fluid. The cellular component of the sample is rarely helpful in identifying further the nature of the cystic structure.  Most inflammatory lesions in the kidney are chronic and produce fibrous connective tissue. Cell harvest from these lesions is usually exceedingly low, and cytology is not typically a useful technique. Pyogenic inflammation can sometimes be diagnosed. Cytology may help diagnose feline infectious peritonitis, although diagnosis using serologic techniques is more common. Because of the usually severe and widespread nature of the inflammation, cell harvest is usually high. The wide mixture of inflammatory cells present in feline infectious peritonitis, with a predominance of neutrophils, along with an appropriate history, are typical of the disorder.  Mammary Cytology: Cytology is useful to differentiate inflammatory from neoplastic nodular lesions within mammary tissue. Mammary tumors are not commonly inflamed. It is less useful to differentiate the neoplastic conditions.  Neoplastic lesions must be interpreted using the criteria listed above ( see Neoplasia:). The criteria most useful to determine the behavior and prognosis of a mammary tumor are local tissue and vessel invasion, not cell morphology. These are best assessed histologically rather than cytologically. Therefore, cellular morphology is not necessarily a good guide to tumor behavior. In cats, malignant cells are often uniform and do not exhibit the normal malignant features; the size of the malignant tumor is the most useful prognostic indicator. Clinical Hematology ByTrevor J.

(Also see Hematopoietic System Introduction.)  Red Blood Cells: Three RBC measurements are routinely done: packed cell volume (PCV), the proportion of whole blood volume occupied by RBCs; hemoglobin (Hgb) concentration of whole lysed blood; and RBC count, the number of RBCs per unit volume of whole blood. Although these are separate estimations, they are in effect three ways to measure the same thing, and it is incorrect to attempt to interpret them as separate variables. Inasmuch as they do vary in relation to each other, they allow calculation of two further meaningful parameters, mean corpuscular volume (MCV) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).   equation  equation MCV varies widely between mammalian species, from ~15 fL in goats to ~90 fL in people. Avian and reptilian red cells are even larger, up to 300 fL. Nevertheless, MCHC varies little with species (or erythrocyte size), at ~330 g/L.  Several artifacts can cause significant and potentially misleading alterations to measured RBC parameters: 1) old samples cause RBCs to swell, thus increasing PCV and MCV and decreasing MCHC; 2) lipemia causes a falsely high Hgb reading, and hence a falsely high MCHC; 3) hemolysis causes PCV to decrease while Hgb remains unchanged, again leading to a falsely high MCHC; 4) underfilling of the tube causes RBCs to shrink, causing PCV and MCV to decrease and MCHC to increase; 5) autoagglutination causes a falsely low RBC count, and hence a falsely high MCV.  Visual description of RBC morphology on a Romanowsky stain also provides useful diagnostic information. The most common terms include 1) normocytic—cells are of normal size; 2) macrocytes—abnormally large cells, usually polychromatophilic; 3) microcytes—abnormally small cells, usually caused by a lack of hemoglobin precursors; 4) anisocytosis—variation in size of cells due to macrocytes, microcytes, or both; 5) normochromic—cells are of normal color; 6) polychromasia—variation in color of the cells, which usually describes the appearance of large, juvenile, bluish-staining polychromatophilic macrocytes (these broadly correspond to the “reticulocyte” seen with new methylene blue staining, in which the reticulum represents the remnants of the nucleus); 7) hypochromasia—decrease in staining density of the cells, usually due to a lack of hemoglobin precursors, especially iron; and 8) annulocyte—extreme form of hypochromic cell with only a thin rim of hemoglobin.  PCV is the variable usually used to assess the basic status of the erythron—increased in polycythemia, decreased in anemia—although if a sample is too hemolyzed to allow measurement of PCV, a meaningful Hgb measurement may still be obtained. RBC count as such should not be interpreted clinically.  An abnormally high PCV (polycythemia) may be relative, due to a change in the proportion of circulating RBCs to blood plasma without any change in the size of the erythron, or absolute, due to a real increase in erythron size. Absolute polycythemia may be primary (eg, polycythemia vera or, rarely, erythropoietin-producing tumors) or secondary (a consequence of disease in another organ system). (Also see Erythrocytosis (Polycythemia).)  Polycythemia vera and erythropoietin-producing tumors should be suspected only when PCV is very high, normally >0.7. The former is characterized by normal, mature RBCs and a normal (or low) erythropoietin concentration, whereas the latter may show a regenerative RBC picture with high erythropoietin concentration. Relative polycythemia may also be associated with very high PCV values, and normal, mature RBCs. Secondary polycythemia generally shows a more modest increase in PCV, often with evidence of regeneration (more so when the cause is pulmonary or cardiac, less so when the cause is hormonal). It is often possible to make the differential diagnosis of polycythemia on clinical grounds.  Abnormally low PCV (anemia) may be caused by loss of blood (hemorrhage), breakdown of RBCs in circulation (hemolysis), or lack of production of RBCs by the bone marrow (hypoplasia or aplasia). Presentation varies according to whether the condition is acute or chronic. Aplastic anemia is always chronic in onset, because anemia occurs gradually as existing cells reach the end of their lifespan. (Also see Anemia.)  In acute hemorrhagic anemia, external blood loss is easily appreciated clinically, but blood loss into a body cavity may be determined only on paracentesis. Initially, all hematologic parameters may be normal, because it may take 12 hr for fluid shifts to produce a decrease in the PCV. Within a few days, RBCs become regenerative, with juvenile forms appearing in circulation (except in horses, in which circulating evidence of regeneration is not readily appreciable). These consist of polychromatophilic macrocytes and normoblasts (nucleated RBCs). Late normoblasts have a small, nonviable nucleus and a moderate amount of cytoplasm colored similarly to that of the polychromatophilic macrocytes, whereas early normoblasts have a larger, viable nucleus and scanty cytoplasm. These are most easily distinguished from lymphocytes by their more densely staining nucleus.  If substantial amounts of blood have been lost from the body, the RBC picture may become hypochromic. Thus, this type of anemia shows an increase in MCV and a decrease in MCHC. If bleeding is into a body cavity, hypochromasia may not be evident because hemoglobin precursors will be recycled. However, slight jaundice may be seen as the sequestered cells are broken down. Some sequestered cells may also be returned to the circulation intact, if somewhat misshapen.  In acute hemolytic anemia, PCV will decrease immediately, and in the early stages some jaundice will be evident. In the very early stages, even a sample collected with extreme care may be markedly hemolyzed. As with hemorrhagic anemia, the RBCs will become regenerative within a few days, with polychromatophilic macrocytes and nucleated RBCs evident. Because hemoglobin precursors are not lost from the body, true hypochromasia is not seen.  Chronic hemorrhagic anemia may be difficult to appreciate if blood is lost in the feces or urine, or due to bloodsucking ectoparasites. Anemia may be severe, and the RBC picture will be regenerative on presentation. Hypochromasia is usually very marked. In very longstanding conditions, depletion of iron and other hemoglobin precursors can become so marked that most of the cells are microcytic, and MCV may paradoxically decrease. Intermittent intra-abdominal hemorrhage leads to a somewhat different picture, because blood shed into the peritoneal cavity can be returned to the circulation. PCV may therefore recover quickly (until the next episode), and signs of depletion of hemoglobin constituents do not emerge.  In chronic hemolytic anemia, RBCs are regenerative on presentation, except that some cases of autoimmune hemolytic anemia (AIHA) paradoxically show little or no regeneration until treatment has been initiated. Hypochromasia is less marked than in hemorrhagic conditions, and misshapen RBCs (including target cells and folded cells) are more common. The spherocyte, in which the erythrocyte loses its classic biconcave shape, is essentially pathognomonic for AIHA. Jaundice may be absent, because the products of the destruction of the RBCs may be cleared by the reticuloendothelial system and the liver as quickly as they are formed.

Hypoplastic and aplastic anemia may be mild if RBC production is merely depressed secondary to some other disease. Protein, mineral, or vitamin deficiencies may cause hypoplastic anemia, but these are more likely to be secondary to another disease (eg, chronic hemorrhage or malabsorption) than simple dietary deficiency. Other diseases may cause depression of erythropoietin production, eg, renal failure, deficiencies of hormones that usually stimulate erythropoietin production (eg, hypothyroidism, hyperadrenocorticism), and chronic, debilitating conditions (eg, chronic infections, chronic parasitism, and neoplasia). RBC morphology is nonregenerative and may be hypochromic if a deficiency state is involved. Paradoxically, vitamin B12 and/or folic acid deficiency produces a macrocytic RBC picture due to early maturation arrest of the erythrocytes. Neoplasia of the bone marrow may cause severe anemia as erythropoietic elements are crowded out, but some regeneration may be seen as the remaining bone marrow attempts to compensate. In this case, other bone marrow cell lines will also be affected.  Nonregenerative anemia, blood smear, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  True aplastic anemia refers to a failure of the entire bone marrow. The shorter-lived granulocytes and platelets decrease first, followed by a progressively severe anemia that is normocytic and normochromic.  White Blood Cells: The WBCs consist of the granulocytes (neutrophils in most mammals, called heterophils in rabbits, reptiles, and birds [and these look like eosinophils in smears]; eosinophils; and basophils) and the agranulocytes (lymphocytes and monocytes). Although each type is traditionally counted by determination of its percentage of the total WBC population, meaningful interpretation requires that the absolute number of each type be calculated by multiplying the total WBC count by the fraction attributable to the individual cell type. Percentages of each cell type alone are not helpful. An increased percentage that is due to an absolute decrease in another cell type is not an increase at all.  Mature neutrophils have a lobulated nucleus, but when demand is high, immature cells with an unlobulated band nucleus (no constriction of the nucleus is more than half the width of the nucleus) may be released into circulation. They function as phagocytes and are important in infectious conditions and in inflammation. Increased neutrophil counts (neutrophilia) are caused by inflammation, bacterial infection, acute stress, steroid effects, and neoplasia of the granulocytic cell line (granulocytic leukemia can be difficult to differentiate from a simple neutrophilia without special stains or bone marrow biopsy). Decreased neutrophil counts (neutropenia) are caused by viral infections, toxin exposure (including foodborne toxins), certain drugs (eg, carbimazole and methimazole), autoimmune destruction of neutrophils, bone marrow neoplasia not involving the granulocytes, and bone marrow aplasia.  Eosinophils are characterized by prominent pink-staining granules on a Romanowsky stain. They inactivate histamine and inhibit edema formation. Increased eosinophil counts (eosinophilia) are caused by allergic/hypersensitivity reactions, parasitism, tissue injury, mast cell tumors, estrus, and pregnancy or parturition in the bitch. Some large dog breeds (eg, German and Belgian Shepherds, Rottweilers) normally have a relatively high eosinophil count. Extremely high eosinophil counts (hypereosinophilic syndrome), possibly due to an out-of-control hypersensitivity reaction, and eosinophil leukemia (a form of chronic myeloid leukemia) are also described. Decreased eosinophil count (eosinopenia) is almost always caused by the action of glucocorticoids, either endogenous or therapeutic.  Basophils are rare in most species and are characterized by blue-staining granules on a Romanowsky stain. They are more easily seen in cattle. They are closely related to mast cells and, like them, initiate the inflammatory response by releasing histamine. An increased basophil count (basophilia) accompanies eosinophilia in some species as part of the hypersensitivity reaction.  Monocytes are large cells with blue-gray cytoplasm, which may be vacuolated, and a kidney bean-shaped or lobulated nucleus. Their main function is phagocytosis, and they are essentially identical to tissue macrophages. An increased monocyte count (monocytosis) may occur in any chronic disease, especially chronic inflammation, and may be very marked in neoplasia. Monocytes also increase as part of the steroid response in dogs.  Lymphocytes mainly develop outside the bone marrow in the lymph nodes, spleen, and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. They are the smallest of the WBCs, with a round, evenly staining nucleus and sparse cytoplasm. Larger, reactive lymphocytes can be seen after antigenic stimulation, and care must be taken to differentiate them from neoplastic lymphocytes. Their primary function is immunologic, including both antibody production and cell-mediated immune responses. Some survive only a few days, but many are long-lived. The number in circulation is a balance between populations in the blood, lymph, lymph nodes, and splenic follicles and does not necessarily reflect changes in lymphopoiesis. An increased lymphocyte count (lymphocytosis) may occur for physiologic reasons, especially in cats, but significant increases usually indicate leukemia. Immature or bizarre cells may also be recognized. Decreased lymphocyte counts (lymphopenia) are usually due to an effect of corticosteroids, either endogenous (stress or Cushing disease) or therapeutic, and may also accompany neutropenia in some viral infections, especially the parvoviruses. Lymphopenia may also be a feature of solid-organ lymphosarcomas, when leukemia is absent.  Platelets: Ecchymosis, abdomen, dog   Image Courtesy of Ontario Veterinary College.

Mammalian platelets are pale blue granular fragments (much smaller than RBCs) shed from multinucleate megakaryocytes in the bone marrow; avian and reptilian platelets are true cells with nuclei. They maintain the integrity of the endothelium and act as part of the clotting process to repair damaged endothelium, where they ensure mechanical strength of the clot.  Increased platelet counts (thrombocytosis) occur as a reaction to consumption after injury, when large juvenile platelets may also appear; after splenectomy, as splenic stores are liberated to the circulation; after vincristine treatment, which increases platelet shedding from megakaryocytes; and in megakaryocytic leukemia.  Decreased platelet counts (thrombocytopenia) are caused by autoimmune reactions, thrombotic/thrombocytopenic purpura, bone marrow suppression and aplasia, bone marrow neoplasia, and equine infectious anemia. Signs are petechiation and ecchymosis more than frank hemorrhage, and little may be seen until the platelet count is < 20 × 109/L. Platelet functional abnormalities present similarly, but platelet numbers and morphology are normal.  Blood Sample Preparation and Evaluation: In-house hematologic investigations, with a minimum of specialist equipment, can provide almost as much information as a full laboratory analysis, although some estimations are qualitative rather than quantitative.  Blood for hematology should be collected into tubes containing EDTA anticoagulant and immediately mixed well to avoid clotting. Larger (2.5 mL) tubes yield better results than the smaller (1 mL) pediatric tubes and are less likely to clot. Nevertheless, it is essential to fill the tube exactly to the mark, so smaller tubes may be unavoidable for small patients. WBC morphology deteriorates most quickly, especially in equine blood, so if the sample cannot be analyzed immediately, a thin blood smear should be submitted to the laboratory with the blood sample.  PCV is measured by microhematocrit, which is the reference method. A capillary tube is filled ¾ full with well-mixed blood and sealed at one end; heat-sealing is best if a Bunsen burner is available, otherwise a proprietary clay pad is used. The tube is spun in a high-speed microhematocrit centrifuge for 6 min, and the PCV is read using a microhematocrit reader with a sliding cursor. The appearance of the plasma (eg, normal, icteric, hemolyzed, lipemic) and the thickness of the buffy coat, which gives a very rough guide to total WBC count, should be noted.  Further information is obtained from a blood film. This is made by using one slide, with a corner broken off as a spreader, to pull a small drop of blood across a clean slide into a thin film. A suitable film is thin (one erythrocyte thick) and tapers to a feathered edge before the far end of the slide. The broken corner of the spreader slide ensures two straight edges parallel to the long edges of the slide. Immediately after the film is spread, it is dried quickly by fanning the slide in the air. Air-dried smears can be sent to the laboratory in a slide mailer or stained and examined in the practice. Commercial rapid Romanowsky-type stains merely require the slide to be dipped in three colored solutions in succession. Cell morphology is clear and comparable to more permanent stains such as Leishman or May-Gruenwald-Giemsa, although quality deteriorates after a few days. The slide should be allowed to dry naturally or dried with a hair dryer (not wiped dry), and examined under oil immersion.  Clinically useful information may be easily achieved in-house for all hematologic variables. The main deficiency is the absence of a numerical WBC count, and hence of numerical values for the differential WBC count. This may be acceptable for an interim emergency investigation, and a WBC count using a hemocytometer slide may be attempted. A mirrored slide with an Improved Neubauer ruling may be used, with a cover slip fitted so that Newton rings are visible on both sides. The blood sample is diluted 1:20 with Turck fluid or a similar diluent. An automatic pipette capable of dispensing 0.95 mL and 0.05 mL (50 μL) should be used to ensure an accurate dilution. The sample should be mixed well and allowed to stand for 10 min while the stain is taken up by the cells. The chamber of the hemocytometer is then filled by using a capillary (PCV) tube. The number of cells in each of the four large corner squares of the grid are counted, and the total divided by 20 to calculate the total WBC count × 10 9/L.  Several hematologic instruments are available for in-practice use. Those based on centrifugation, in which WBC measurements are made by spreading a stained buffy coat, are not true hematology analyzers, but give approximate counts. Although a numerical estimate of total WBC count is provided, the differential WBC count cannot distinguish between lymphocytes and monocytes, and results do not always correlate well with standard methods. This method is appropriate only as an emergency approximation, and a blood film must always be examined in addition. It is also wise to check the PCV by microhematocrit.  Impedance counters (Coulter principle) are used by diagnostic laboratories and perform well in experienced hands. However, it is difficult to achieve optimal performance without trained technical staff. Instruments not based on the Coulter principle should be avoided for veterinary use, because their results do not necessarily compare well on nonhuman samples. Instruments providing automated differential counts perform poorly on nonhuman blood, and results must never be accepted without also checking a blood film. No hematology laboratory should be without the facility for examining blood films, and a blood film should be examined for every patient sample. Quality assurance issues are the same as those for biochemistry laboratories ( see Clinical Biochemistry). If accuracy and reliability cannot be guaranteed to the same standard as the referral laboratory, then results should not be relied on without external confirmation.  Red Blood Cells: The size, uniformity of size, and presence of microcytes, macrocytes, and abnormally shaped cells should be noted, along with cell color, uniformity of color, and the presence of hypochromasia, polychromasia, and nucleated RBCs. An overall descriptive assessment of the RBC picture should be made, including the degree of regeneration or hypochromasia, if any.  White Blood Cells: A qualitative estimate of numbers should be made (ie, very low, low, normal, high, very high). This can be remarkably consistent with practice. The proportions of each cell type can be estimated, or preferably, a formal differential count of 100–200 cells performed. Unusual or abnormal WBC forms (eg, band or toxic neutrophils), or pathologic cells (eg, prolymphocytes, lymphoblasts, or mast cells) should be noted.  Platelets: A qualitative estimate of platelet numbers, based on how many can be seen in a typical high-power field (oil immersion) should be made. Several fields should be examined, more if numbers appear low. Results can be ranked as none seen (on entire slide), rare (very few on entire slide), low in number (< 5 per high-power field), adequate (5–20 per high-power field), or abundant (>20 per high-power field). Normal platelet numbers in the horse are about half those of other species. In a sample more than a few hours old, platelets may clump into rafts, leaving areas of the slide apparently devoid of platelets. Slides should be scanned for rafts before reporting platelet numbers as low. Enlarged or macroplatelets should also be noted. Urinalysis ByTrevor J.

It is useful to document various types of urinary tract diseases and may provide information about other systemic diseases, such as liver failure and hemolysis. Urine may be collected by cystocentesis, urethral catheterization, or voiding. Urine should be evaluated within 30 min, but if this is not possible, it may be refrigerated for up to 24 hr or submitted to an outside diagnostic laboratory; however, this may result in crystal precipitation. Refrigeration does not alter urine pH or specific gravity. If cytologic evaluation is required and a delay in preparing the slides is anticipated, then a preservative should be added. A few drops of 10% formalin (exact concentration not necessary) is better than boric acid. However, the usual Romanowsky stains are unsuitable with formalin; if submitting to an outside laboratory, it should be communicated that formalin has been added.  Urine Appearance Color: Normal urine is typically transparent and yellow or amber on visual inspection. The intensity of color is in part related to the volume of urine collected and concentration of urine produced; therefore, it should be interpreted in context of urine specific gravity. Significant disease may exist when urine color is normal. Abnormal urine color may be caused by presence of endogenous or exogenous pigments, but it does not provide specific information. Interpretation of semiquantitative reagent strips, which are colorimetric tests, requires knowledge of urine color because discolored urine may result in a false-positive result. Equine urine may turn brown after a period of time.  Clarity: Urine is typically clear but may become less transparent with pigmenturia, crystalluria, hematuria, pyuria, lipiduria, or when other compounds such as mucus are present. Depending on the cause, increased turbidity may disappear with centrifugation of the sample.  Odor: Normal urine has a slight odor of ammonia; however, the odor depends on urine concentration. Some species, such as cats and goats, have pungent urine odor because of urine composition. Bacterial infection may result in a strong odor due to pyuria; a strong ammonia odor may occur if the bacteria produce urease.  Urine Chemistries Urine must be at room temperature for accurate measurement of urine specific gravity and for chemical analysis. These tests are usually done before centrifugation; however, if urine is discolored or turbid, it may be beneficial to perform these tests on supernatant ( see Urine Sediment).  Specific Gravity: Specific gravity is defined as the ratio of the weight of a volume of liquid to the weight of an equal volume of distilled water; therefore, it depends on the number, size, and weight of particles in the liquid. It is different from osmolality, which depends only on the number of particles in the liquid; measurement of osmolality requires specialized instrumentation.  The urine specific gravity (SG) is determined using a refractometer designed for veterinary samples, which includes a scale calibrated specifically for cat urine. SG for species other than cats should be determined using the scale for dogs. In healthy animals, SG is highly variable, depending on fluid and electrolyte balance of the body. It is normally at least 1.015. Interpretation of SG, therefore, depends on the clinical presentation and serum chemistry findings. ( See also heading on page Urinary System Introduction.) An animal that is dehydrated or has other causes of prerenal azotemia will have hypersthenuric urine with an SG >1.025–1.040 (depending on species). Dilute urine in a dehydrated or azotemic animal is abnormal and could be caused by renal failure, hypo- or hyperadrenocorticism, hypercalcemia, diabetes mellitus, hyperthyroidism, and diuretic therapy. In cases of diabetes insipidus, values < 1.010 can be expected. Glucosuria increases the SG despite increased urine volume.  Semiquantitative, Colorimetric Reagent Strips: Reagent strips such as Multistix® or Chemstrip ® can be used to perform several semiquantitative chemical evaluations simultaneously. They are used routinely to determine urine pH, protein, glucose, ketones, bilirubin/urobilinogen, and occult blood. Some reagent strips include test pads for leukocyte esterase (for detection of WBCs), nitrite (for detection of bacteria), and SG; these are not valid in animals and should not be used. Reagent strips are adversely affected by moisture and have a limited shelf life. Bottles should be kept tightly capped, and unused strips should be discarded after their expiration date.  Urine pH: Urine pH is typically acidic in dogs and cats and alkaline in horses and ruminants, but varies depending on diet, medications, or presence of disease. Reagent strip colorimetric test pads for pH determination are accurate to within ~0.5 pH units. For example, a reading of 6.5 means the actual pH is likely to be between 6.0 and 7.0. Portable pH meters are more accurate than pH colorimetric test pads. A bacterial urinary tract infection with a urease-producing microbe will result in alkaluria. Urine pH will affect crystalluria because some crystals, such as struvite, form in alkaline urine, whereas other crystals, such as cystine, form in acidic urine.  Protein: The protein test pad uses a color indicator (tetrabromophenol blue), which detects primarily albumin in urine. Results range from 10 mg/dL to 1,000 mg/dL. Proteinuria can occur from prerenal (fever, strenuous exercise, seizures, extreme environmental temperature, and hyperproteinemia), renal (primarily glomerular and occasionally tubular disease), or postrenal (inflammation, hemorrhage, and infection) causes. A positive reaction must be interpreted in light of SG, pH, and urine sediment examination. For example, a trace amount of protein in concentrated urine is less significant than a trace amount of protein in dilute urine. Alkaluria will give a false-positive reaction. Likewise, presence of other proteins, such as Bence-Jones proteins, will give false-negative results. Proteinuria can be measured using sulfosalicylic acid precipitation, which detects albumin and globulins; however, it is not accurate in dogs and cats. If proteinuria is present with an inactive urine sediment, its significance can be verified and quantitated by dividing the urine protein concentration by the urine creatinine concentration (urine protein to urine creatinine ratio [UP:UC]). Interpretation of a UP:UC is as follows: < 0.5:1 (dogs) and < 0.4:1 (cats) is normal, 0.4 or 0.5–1:1 is questionable, and >1:1 is abnormal. With primary renal azotemia, a UP:UC >0.5:1 in dogs and >0.4:1 in cats is considered abnormal. A semiquantitative microalbuminuria test is available to detect urinary albumin in the range of 1–30 mg/dL. It uses ELISA technology specific for canine or feline albumin. Because of minor species differences in albumin, there are different kits for dogs and cats. The microalbuminuria test detects lower concentrations of albumin than a standard dipstick test pad. Hematuria must be macroscopic to increase the microalbuminuria or UP:UC; however, pyuria increases both.  Glucose: Glucose is detected by a glucose oxidase enzymatic reaction that is specific for glucose. Glucosuria is not present normally because the renal threshold for glucose is >180 mg/dL in most species and >240 mg/dL in cats. With euglycemia, the amount of filtered glucose is less than the renal threshold, and all of the filtered glucose is reabsorbed in the proximal renal tubules. Glucosuria can result from hyperglycemia (due to diabetes mellitus, excessive endogenous or exogenous glucocorticoids, hepatocutaneous syndrome, or stress) or from a proximal renal tubular defect (such as primary renal glucosuria or Fanconi syndrome). If glucosuria is present, blood glucose concentration should be determined. False-negative results can occur with high urinary concentrations of ascorbic acid (vitamin C) or with formaldehyde (a metabolite of the urinary antiseptic, methenamine, which may be used for prevention of bacterial urinary tract infections). False-positive results may occur if the sample is contaminated with hydrogen peroxide, chlorine, or hypochlorite (bleach).  Ketones: Ketones are produced from fatty acid metabolism and include acetoacetic acid, acetone, and β-hydroxybutyrate. The ketone test pad detects acetone and acetoacetic acid, but not β-hydroxybutyrate (which can be measured in blood and urine using a point-of-care instrument or a biochemistry analyzer). The test pad contains nitroprusside that reacts with acetoacetic acid and acetone to cause a purple color change; it is more sensitive to acetoacetic acid than acetone. Ketonuria is associated with primary ketosis (ruminants), ketosis secondary to diabetes mellitus (small animals), consumption of low-carbohydrate diets (especially in cats), and occasionally with prolonged fasting or starvation. A false-positive reaction can occur with presence of reducing substances in urine.  Bilirubin/Urobilinogen: When hemoglobin is degraded, the heme portion is converted to bilirubin, which is conjugated in the liver and excreted in bile. Some conjugated bilirubin is filtered by the glomerulus and excreted in urine. In dogs, but not cats, the kidney can metabolize hemoglobin to bilirubin and secrete it. Male dogs have a higher secretory ability than females. Dipstick reagent pads use diazonium salts to create a color change and are more sensitive to conjugated bilirubin than unconjugated bilirubin. Bilirubinuria occurs when conjugated bilirubin exceeds the renal threshold as with liver disease or hemolysis. In dogs with concentrated urine, a small amount of bilirubin can be normal. Pigmenturia and phenothiazine may result in a false-positive reaction; false-negative reactions may occur with large amounts of urinary ascorbic acid (vitamin C).  Urobilinogen, formed from bilirubin by intestinal microflora, is absorbed into the portal circulation and excreted renally. A small amount of urinary urobilinogen is normal. Increased urinary urobilinogen occurs with hyperbilirubinemia; a negative test may be seen with biliary obstruction. However, the test is not specific enough to be clinically useful.  Occult Blood: The occult blood test pad uses a “pseudoperoxidase” method to detect intact RBCs, hemoglobin, and myoglobin. A positive reaction can be due to hemorrhage (hematuria), intravascular hemolysis (hemoglobinuria), or myoglobinuria. The latter two processes can be distinguished by examination of plasma: plasma will appear pink to red after intravascular hemolysis, whereas myoglobin is rapidly cleared from plasma, resulting in clear plasma. As with other colorimetric test pads, discolored urine may yield false-positive results. A positive result should be interpreted with microscopic examination of urine sediment.  Urine Sediment Microscopic examination of urine sediment should be part of a routine urinalysis. For centrifugation, 3–5 mL of urine is transferred to a conical centrifuge tube. Urine is centrifuged at 1,000–1,500 rpm for ~3–5 min. The supernatant is decanted, leaving ~0.5 mL of urine and sediment in the tip of the conical tube. The sediment is resuspended by tapping the tip of the conical tube against the table several times. A few drops of the sediment are transferred to a glass slide, and a cover slip is applied. Examination of unstained urine is recommended for routine samples. Microscopic examination is performed at 100× (for crystals, casts, and cells) and 400× (for cells and bacteria) magnifications. Contrast of the sample is enhanced by closing the iris diaphragm and lowering the condenser of the microscope. Stains such as Sedistain® and new methylene blue can be used to aid in cell identification but may dilute the specimen and introduce artifacts such as stain precipitate and crystals. Use of a modified Wright stain increases the sensitivity, specificity, and positive and negative predictive values for detection of bacteria. For some tests, air dried, stained smears are necessary.  Red Blood Cells: In an unstained preparation, RBCs are small and round and have a slight orange tint and a smooth appearance. Normal urine should contain < 5 RBCs/field at 400× magnification. Increased RBCs in urine (hematuria) indicates hemorrhage somewhere in the urogenital system; however, sample collection by cystocentesis or catheterization may induce hemorrhage.  White Blood Cells: WBCs are slightly larger than RBCs and have grainy cytoplasm. Normal urine should contain < 5 WBCs/field at 400× magnification. Increased WBCs (pyuria) can occur due to inflammation, infection, trauma, or neoplasia. Catheterization or collection of voided urine may introduce a few WBCs from the urogenital tract.  Epithelial Cells: Transitional epithelial cells, a common urine contaminant derived from the bladder and proximal urethra, resemble WBCs but are larger. They have a greater amount of grainy cytoplasm and a round, centrally located nucleus. In a voided urine sample, squamous epithelial cells may be seen. They are large, oval to cuboidal in shape, and may or may not contain a nucleus. Occasionally, neoplastic transitional cells may be seen in an animal with a transitional cell carcinoma. Neoplastic squamous cells may be seen in an animal with a squamous cell carcinoma.  Cylindruria (Casts): Casts are elongated, cylindrical structures formed by mucoprotein congealing within renal tubules and may contain cells. Hyaline casts are pure protein precipitates; they are transparent, have parallel sides and rounded ends, and are composed of mucoprotein. They may occur with fever, exercise, and renal disease. Epithelial cellular casts form from entrapment of sloughed tubular epithelial cells in the mucoprotein; they may be seen with renal tubular disease. Granular casts are thought to represent degenerated epithelial cellular casts. Waxy casts have a granular appearance and are thought to arise from degeneration of longstanding granular casts. They typically have sharp borders with broken ends. Other cellular casts include RBC casts and WBC casts and are always abnormal. RBC casts form because of renal hemorrhage. WBC casts form because of renal inflammation, as with pyelonephritis. Fatty casts are not common but can be seen with disorders of lipid metabolism, such as diabetes mellitus. A few hyaline or granular casts are considered normal. However, presence of cellular casts or other casts in high numbers indicates renal damage, and may be one of the earliest laboratory abnormalities noted with toxic damage to renal epithelial cells (eg, gentamicin, amphotericin B).  Infectious Organisms: The presence of bacteria in urine collected by cystocentesis indicates infection. Small numbers of bacteria from the lower urogenital tract may contaminate voided samples or samples collected by catheterization and do not indicate infection. Bacterial rods are most easily identified in urine sediment. Particles of debris may be mistaken for bacteria. Suspected bacteria can be confirmed by staining urine sediment with Gram stain; however, aerobic culture is best to confirm a bacterial urinary tract infection. Rarely, yeast and fungal hyphae and parasitic ova may be seen in urine sediment. Their presence is not always associated with clinical disease. Parasitic ova observed include those of Stephanurus dentatus, Capillaria plica, C felis, and Dioctophyma renale. Additionally, microfilariae of Dirofilaria immitis may be seen in urine sediment.  Crystals: Many urine sediments contain crystals. The type of crystal present depends on urine pH, concentration of crystallogenic materials, urine temperature, and length of time between urine collection and examination. Crystalluria is not synonymous with urolithiasis and is not necessarily pathologic. Furthermore, uroliths may form without observed crystalluria. Many urine samples are examined at room temperature, which may alter the number of crystals present, and the result may not represent the situation in vivo.  Struvite crystals are commonly seen in canine and feline urine. Struvite crystalluria in dogs is not a problem unless there is a concurrent bacterial urinary tract infection with a urease-producing microbe. Without an infection, struvite crystals in dogs are not associated with struvite urolith formation. However, some animals (eg, cats) do form struvite uroliths without a bacterial urinary tract infection. In these animals, struvite crystalluria may be pathologic. Struvite crystals appear typically as “coffin-lids” or “prisms”; however, they may be amorphous.  Calcium oxalate crystalluria occurs less commonly in dogs and cats. If persistent, it may indicate an increased risk of calcium oxalate urolith formation, which has been increasing in some countries throughout the past few years. ( See also page Urolithiasis in Horses and feline interstitial cystitis.) However, calcium oxalate and calcium carbonate crystalluria is common in healthy horses and cattle. Calcium oxalate dihydrate crystals appear as squares with an “X” in the middle, or “envelope-shaped.” Calcium oxalate monohydrate crystals are “dumb-bell” shaped. An unusual form of calcium oxalate crystals is typically seen in association with ethylene glycol toxicity ( see Ethylene Glycol Toxicosis). These crystals are found in neutral to acidic urine. They are small, flat, and colorless and are shaped like “picket fence posts.”  Ammonium acid urate crystals suggest liver disease (eg, portosystemic shunt). These crystals occur in acidic urine and are yellow-brown spheres with irregular, spiny projections; however, they may also be amorphous. Certain species, such as birds and reptiles, and certain breeds of dogs, specifically Dalmatians, can normally have ammonium acid urate crystalluria.  Cystine crystals are six-sided and of variable size. They are seen in acidic urine. Presence of cystine crystals represents a proximal tubular defect in amino acid reabsorption. Cystinuria has been reported in many breeds of dogs and rarely in cats. Dachshunds, Newfoundlands, English Bulldogs, and Scottish Terriers have a high incidence of cystine urolithiasis.  Bilirubin crystals occur with bilirubinuria; however, they may be normal in small numbers in dogs.  Lipids: Fat droplets are commonly present in urine from dogs and cats and may be mistaken for RBCs. They often vary in size and tend to float on a different plane of focus than the remainder of the sediment. They are not considered to be pathologic.  Spermatozoa: Spermatozoa may be seen normally in urine collected from reproductively intact male dogs.  Plant Material: Occasionally, plant material may be seen in urine samples collected by voiding. When present, they indicate contamination of the urine sample and are not pathologic.  Bladder Tumor Antigen Test The bladder tumor antigen test can be used to screen for transitional cell carcinoma in dogs. The results are not specific for transitional cell carcinoma, and non-neoplastic disease (eg, urinary tract infections, hematuria, etc) can give positive results. A negative test, however, is meaningful in that a transitional cell carcinoma is not likely to be present. This test may be useful for routine screening of dogs at higher risk of developing transitional cell carcinoma (eg, Scottish terriers) that do not have other signs or laboratory findings of lower urinary tract disease. This tests for the presence of basement membrane fragments and is a color reaction using a commercial test kit. Serologic Test Kits ByTrevor J.

They include tests for infectious disease by measuring either antigens or antibodies. Antibody levels can also be measured to establish the presence of adequate protection to an infectious agent. However, these levels are not an absolute measure of protection. High serum antibody levels do not always confer protection, and low levels do not always indicate susceptibility to infection. The level of cell-mediated immunity is also important. Measurement of hormone levels also use serologic tests. Many of these tests are ELISA that may be microwell or membrane-based, but other types, including immunomigration, immunochromatography, and agglutination tests, are also available. Sample requirements may be plasma, serum, whole blood, feces, or saliva, depending on the test format.  Feline Leukemia Virus (FeLV): Serologic testing for FeLV is important to identify infected cats and prevent transmission of the virus ( see Feline Leukemia Virus). Testing is also recommended before vaccination against FeLV, because vaccination of infected cats will not limit development or transmission of disease. Most currently available in-house diagnostic kits are designed to detect soluble FeLV-specific gag protein p 27, which is produced in large amounts during viremia. The time between infection and the presence of detectable antigen varies but is likely to be within 28–30 days. Vaccination against FeLV will not yield a positive test result when antigen tests are used, nor will the presence of maternally derived antibodies in kittens. Testing serum, plasma, or whole blood is considered more reliable than testing saliva or tears. Most test kits have positive and negative controls incorporated into the kit, so technical problems with running the test may be detected.  A negative result on a screening test is very reliable; however, false-positive results may occur with the tests of soluble antigen, especially in a population of cats with a low incidence of disease. A true positive result may reflect either transient or persistent viremia, so clinical decisions should not be based on a single test result. Confirmation of positive results, especially in asymptomatic cats, should be pursued by additional testing such as soluble antigen testing using a kit from a different manufacturer or immunofluorescent antigen testing on blood or bone marrow. Cats with discordant results should be retested using both test methods in 60 days and should probably be considered potentially infective until their status is clarified.  Some cats previously thought to have cleared infection have been identified using real-time PCR, which is a very sensitive method to detect cell-associated FeLV proviral DNA or viral RNA. These cats are proviral DNA positive but FeLV antigen negative and are unlikely to shed virus or develop clinical disease. However, proviral FeLV could be transmitted in blood transfusions, so potential feline blood donors should be PCR negative for FeLV.  Feline Immunodeficiency Virus (FIV): Because the concentration of FIV antigen in the blood of infected cats is often very low, in-house diagnostic tests are designed to detect anti-FIV antibodies rather than antigen. Test kits yield a positive or negative result for antibody rather than a titer. Antibodies usually develop within 60 days of infection, but this period is quite variable, and a few infected cats do not develop detectable antibody levels. Once present, antibodies appear to be present for >2 yr, except for those transiently detectable in kittens that have maternally derived antibodies. A kitten < 6 mo of age that tests positive should be retested after 6 mo of age for this reason. If the test is still positive, the kitten is most likely infected.  With the currently available ELISA in-house test kits, sensitivity is high. However, these tests cannot distinguish between antibodies produced in response to vaccination with FIV vaccine and those produced by natural infection. An ELISA test that appears to successfully discriminate between antibodies produced in response to vaccination and those produced in natural infections has been developed but is not available for commercial use. A reasonable approach is to use the in-house test as a screening test. A negative result is a fairly reliable indicator that the cat is not infected. Positive results, especially in asymptomatic cats, should be confirmed by another test such as Western blot if available. Kittens born to vaccinated queens are antibody-positive for a variable length of time.  Canine Parvovirus (CPV): Both ELISA and immunomigration test kits are available for detection of CPV antigen in feces. These tests are fairly specific for the virus, but dogs that have been recently vaccinated may transiently shed antigens detected by the test kits. The sensitivity is somewhat lower for several reasons. Fecal shedding occurs for only ~7–10 days, beginning on day 3–5 after exposure, so virus is not always detectable in dogs with clinical signs. Blood in the feces as well as the formation of antigen-antibody complexes, with antibodies from the blood or exudate present in the gut, may be associated with false-negative results. It appears that in-house test kits may have decreased sensitivity to the new CPV2c strain.  Although in-house test kits for diagnosis of CPV are not licensed for use in cats, several studies have shown they can be used to detect feline panleukopenia virus in cat feces. The specificity and sensitivity are not known. Some cats test positive after vaccination, even when inactivated virus vaccines are used.  In-house tests for assay of anti-CPV antibodies have become available to evaluate the need for revaccination and the presence of possibly interfering maternal antibodies. These tests are not intended to diagnose parvovirus infection and do not distinguish between natural exposure and vaccine-induced antibodies. Currently available test kits include ELISA and immunochromatographic tests. They are semiquantitative and use color changes in positive control wells compared with color changes in samples to determine relative antibody levels. The level of anti-CPV antibody protective against infection is not known, but results are interpreted based on protective titers measured by other methods. PCR is widely available for detection of virus in feces.  Canine Distemper Virus (CDV): In-house test kits for determination of antibodies to CDV are available, usually in combination with canine parvovirus antibody testing. These tests are semiquantitative ELISA for anti-canine distemper IgG in serum or plasma. They may be used to evaluate the need for revaccination and to determine the level of maternal antibody present in puppies. They are less useful for diagnosis of infection with CDV. An immunochromatography-based assay for CDV antigen has been developed and has good sensitivity and specificity, especially when conjunctival swabs are the sample used; sensitivity and specificity are somewhat less for blood and nasal swabs. This assay is not currently available as an in-house test kit.  Borrelia burgdorferi: Lyme disease ( see Lyme Borreliosis) is caused by the tickborne spirochete B burgdorferi. In general, diagnostic tests for this infection have had several potential problems, including relatively high levels of positive results in clinically healthy animals, persistence of antibodies after apparent resolution of clinical disease, interpretation of antibody titers in vaccinated dogs, and the fact that detectable antibody may not be present until 4–6 wk after exposure. An in-clinic ELISA test kit for detection of anti–B burgdorferi antibodies in serum or plasma minimizes some of these problems by using a synthetic peptide (C6) based on a conserved B burgdorferi–specific protein. This protein is important in inducing a humoral immune response by 3–5 wk after natural infection in dogs. Vaccination does not induce a cross-reactive immune response to this antigen, so assays using the C6 protein are able to distinguish vaccine-induced antibodies from those produced in response to natural infections. C6-based assays are also more specific than previous tests, because there is no cross-reactivity with other tickborne agents or with autoimmune antibodies.  A currently available in-house test assay for anti–B burgdorferi antibodies is a screening test that gives only a positive or negative result and is thus not quantitative. Although licensed for dogs, this test kit also has been validated in cats and horses. Quantitative assays, performed in reference laboratories, can be used to monitor treatment efficacy (ie, detection of decreasing antibody titers), but these results are not always conclusive.  Ehrlichia canis: Canine ehrlichiosis ( see Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Related Infections in Animals) is a tickborne disease caused by one of several species of Ehrlichia. It can be associated with thrombocytopenia, anemia, and neutropenia as well as other nonspecific clinical signs. Although identification of Ehrlichia morulae in leukocytes can be diagnostic for this infection, serologic assay for detection of antibodies is more common and has better sensitivity. In-house tests for ehrlichiosis are either qualitative (giving only a positive or negative result) or semiquantitative tests for antibodies to E canis. Those currently available are ELISA to be performed on serum, plasma, or whole blood. The test kits use either recombinant analogues of major outer membrane proteins of E canis or whole E canis proteins as the antigen. The different Ehrlichia species stimulate antibodies that appear to cross-react in these assays, for the most part. Because anti−E canis antibodies may be very long-lived and may be present in subclinical infections, detection of these antibodies does not distinguish between exposure and Ehrlichia-induced illness and cannot reliably indicate success of response to therapy.  Brucella canis: B canis is not a problem in some countries, and tests are not always readily available. However, infection may be subclinical, or it may cause a variety of clinical signs, including abortion, infertility, and discospondylitis ( see Brucellosis in Dogs). Infection most often occurs during mating; thus, testing of breeding animals is important in disease prevention. A rapid slide agglutination test that includes a 2-mercaptoethanol (2-ME) step to reduce false-positive results by eliminating nonspecific IgM reactions is available as an in-house diagnostic kit. This assay detects serum antibody to surface antigens of the bacteria. Reports of sensitivity and specificity of this test vary depending on the confirmatory test used. ELISA and immunochromatographic assays have been developed for qualitative and semiquantitative tests for anti–B canis antibodies. Positive results obtained using any of these test kits should be confirmed with PCR or blood culture.  Heartworm Antigen—Dogs: Serologic testing for heartworm antigen in dogs is more sensitive than screening for microfilaremia and, in addition, can detect occult infections. Heartworm antigen is first detectable at ~5 mo after infection and will usually precede microfilaremia by a few weeks; however, this time frame may be shifted later in animals on macrocyclic lactone preventives and those with low numbers of worms. Antigen test formats available include ELISA and immunochromatographic assays. Serum or plasma may be used in all kits, and some may be performed using whole blood. Some test kits can be stored at room temperature, whereas others must be stored refrigerated and brought to room temperature before use. Batch testing and single sample testing are both available. All of the test kits have very high specificity. False-positive results are most often due to technical problems such as inadequate washing or failure to read the results at the optimal time. Manufacturer’s instructions should be closely followed with any of the test formats.  Sensitivity varies from one test to another and is affected by worm load, worm gender (a female antigen is detected, thus male-only infections will not be detected), and maturity of female worms. None of these tests has 100% sensitivity. When unexpected false results are obtained on an antigen test, additional testing, using a different format, is recommended.  After adulticide treatment, antigenemia should become undetectable by 6 mo. However, it can take more than a month for some adult heartworms to die, so a positive antigen test at 5–6 mo after treatment does not necessarily indicate treatment failure. The test should be repeated 2–3 mo later.  Heartworm Antibody and Antigen—Cats: Heartworm disease in cats is substantially different from the disease in dogs, and recommendations for serologic testing are consequently different. Cats tend to have a much lower worm burden—often only one or two worms. Cats also have single-sex infections more frequently than do dogs. Circulating microfilaremia is rare in cats, and microfilariae have a shorter life span. These differences are often attributed to a more effective feline immune response to heartworm infection. However, heartworms can cause serious disease in cats.  Heartworm antigen tests are less sensitive for detection of infection in cats than they are in dogs, with a reported sensitivity of 50%–80%. Therefore, a negative antigen test does not exclude heartworm infection. Antibody testing is also available and can be useful as a screening test, but the presence of antibody does not confirm feline heartworm disease. Transient exposure to larvae will stimulate production of antibody; many early infections are cleared spontaneously, and adult heartworms never develop. A combination of testing for both heartworm antigen and anti-heartworm antibody results in much higher sensitivity and specificity than using either test method alone. Combination testing is warranted in cats with clinical signs of heartworm disease when results of a single test are not conclusive.  Test kits for detection of heartworm antigen and anti-heartworm antibody in cats are marketed in several formats. These can use either plasma or serum and are qualitative or semiquantitative.  Canine and Feline Pregnancy Diagnosis—Relaxin: The only known pregnancy-specific hormone in the bitch and queen is relaxin, which is produced by the placenta when a fertilized egg is implanted. Relaxin is first detectable in the plasma around day 20–25 after fertilization. It is not present in pseudopregnant or nonpregnant bitches or queens. Relaxin levels peak by approximately day 40–50 of gestation and drop at parturition, but they may remain detectable for up to 50 days during lactation. In-clinic test kits to measure relaxin include microwell ELISA and immunomigration qualitative tests requiring serum, plasma, or whole blood. The assays appear to have very good specificity, ie, a detectable level of relaxin is not found in nonpregnant animals. False-negative results have been reported in some bitches carrying very small litters or in those with one or more nonviable puppies.  Canine and Feline Luteinizing Hormone—Ovulation Timing and Ovariectomy Status: In the bitch, serum luteinizing hormone (LH) is normally present in very low levels except for a dramatic rise just before ovulation. Ovulation occurs 2 days after this LH surge, and the LH level returns to baseline within 24–40 hr of peaking. Serum progesterone levels begin to rise at the time of the LH surge. A bitch will be fertile between 4–7 days after the LH surge, with the most fertile period on days 5 and 6. In addition, the LH surge determines the gestation period, with parturition occurring between day 64 and 66 after the surge. The LH surge may occur anywhere from 3 days before to 5 days after the onset of estrous behavior, so it cannot be reliably predicted by behavior.  Ovulation timing by measurement of LH requires daily testing, which usually begins when >50% of vaginal epithelial cells are cornified, based on vaginal cytology. There is occasionally a false LH peak not followed by ovulation, but it will also not be followed by an increase in progesterone. For that reason, assays of both LH and progesterone are recommended for most accurate ovulation detection. An increased LH concentration not followed by increased progesterone levels is considered a proestrus fluctuation, and testing for ovulation should continue.  A currently available in-clinic kit to measure LH concentrations in serum is essentially qualitative, with a serum level of < 1 ng/mL being read as negative and a level of >1 ng/mL considered positive. The test is an immunochromatographic assay.  Ovariectomized bitches and queens have serum concentrations of LH >1 ng/mL. Because this LH concentration is also seen in intact bitches about to ovulate, a single high LH concentration does not confirm reproductive status, but a low LH concentration indicates a nonovariectomized animal.  Canine Ovulation Timing—Progesterone: Serum progesterone begins to increase after the LH surge with a modest increase on the day before ovulation and a further increase to 4–10 ng/mL on the day of ovulation. Progesterone continues to increase and stays increased throughout pregnancy or diestrus. As the rise in progesterone is more constant compared with LH, daily testing is not necessary. It is recommended that testing begin in late proestrus and continue every 2–3 days until a high range is reached, indicating ovulation.  The test kits for in-clinic progesterone testing are semiquantitative ELISA with preovulatory concentrations designated according to the kit used. Some kits are designed to give two additional progesterone ranges (intermediate and high), whereas others indicate only preovulatory and “ovulatory day or later” levels. In comparison with other test methods, the in-house test kits are less accurate, particularly in the range of roughly 1.5–10 ng/mL, which is the range of interest for earliest detection of ovulation. Accuracy is greater at higher progesterone levels. As mentioned above, measurement of both LH and progesterone is recommended for most accurate breeding management.  Thyroxine: Assay of total serum thyroxine (T4) may be used as a screening test for canine hypothyroidism or as a diagnostic test for feline hyperthyroidism. (Also see The Thyroid Gland.) In addition, T4 concentrations are measured when monitoring therapy for hypo- or hyperthyroidism. An in-house ELISA test kit, which uses an additional instrument to read results, provides semiquantitative information about T4 concentration in canine and feline sera. The assay is run at one of two “dynamic ranges,” depending on the predicted range of results. Published studies comparing this assay with other test methods for T4 vary in their conclusions. It is recommended that T4 concentrations be periodically measured in stored pooled serum of cats and dogs to monitor whether assay performance is consistent. It is probably still better to use a commercial laboratory for thyroxine measurement.  Almost all (99%) of total T4 is bound to protein in the blood and therefore not biologically accurate. Free T4 levels are a more accurate test of thyroid function in cats and dogs.  Foal Immunoglobulin (IgG): Measurement of foal serum IgG concentration within the first 24 hr after birth can be useful in preventing disease related to failure of passive transfer of IgG in colostrum from mare to foal. Use of foal-side testing procedures can facilitate prompt diagnosis and treatment. A foal serum IgG level of >800 mg/dL is generally considered optimal, with < 200 mg/dL indicating failure of passive transfer. Concentrations of 200–800 mg/dL are considered evidence of partial transfer.  Although radial immunodiffusion is considered the most accurate test for IgG concentration, it takes much longer (5–24 hr) than many of the other test methods and thus is not as useful as an indicator of the need for therapeutic intervention. More rapid screening tests include the zinc sulfate turbidity test, glutaraldehyde clot test, and ELISA test kits.  The zinc sulfate test estimates IgG in serum based on its precipitation when added to a zinc-containing solution. Turbidity generally becomes visible when IgG levels are 400–500 mg/dL. This test takes ~1 hr and may be performed with zinc sulfate solutions made in the clinic, or reagents for the test may be purchased as a test kit.  The glutaraldehyde clot test requires the addition of 1 volume of serum to 10 volumes of 10% glutaraldehyde and examination of the tubes at timed intervals up to 60 min. The presence of IgG in the serum causes a solid clot to form in the tube. Clot formation in < 10 min generally correlates to an IgG concentration of >800 mg/dL, whereas a positive reaction within 60 min is interpreted as an IgG concentration of >400 mg/dL. Both of these test methods use serum, rather than plasma, so time for the blood to clot and separation of serum must be added to the time needed to perform the test.  ELISA test kits for in-house or foal-side testing can use either serum or whole blood as the sample and take ~10 min. Most are semiquantitative, with color changes corresponding to IgG concentrations of < 400 mg/dL, 400–800 mg/dL, or >800 mg/dL. One quantitative handheld colorimetric immunoassay is currently available.  Reports of sensitivity and specificity among these methods vary. In general, sensitivity in identifying foals with IgG concentrations < 400 mg/dL appears to be acceptable for all methods. Thus, there are few foals with total failure of passive transfer that would not be identified by any of these methods. Specificity is less acceptable for some of the methods, and treatment of some foals that did not need it might be instituted based on the results.  Calf Immunoglobulin: Measurement of IgG concentration in neonatal calf serum is important for the same reasons described for foals. However, IgG levels in calves are different from those in foals, with >1,000 mg/dL considered evidence of adequate passive transfer and < 1,000 mg/dL indicating failure of passive transfer. Radial immunodiffusion is the gold standard for accurate measurement of serum IgG in calves (as in foals), but the length of time required to complete this assay makes it less useful than other methods. Other methods include zinc sulfate and sodium sulfite turbidity tests, glutaraldehyde coagulation test, measurement of total serum solids by refractometry, and a lateral flowthrough ELISA test kit.  The sodium sulfite and zinc sulfate turbidity tests are both based on the precipitation of high-molecular-weight proteins in these solutions. Serum is used as the sample, and tests are read after 15–30 min of incubation. Results of these tests vary in sensitivity and specificity depending on the endpoint chosen, and technical difficulties with reagents can decrease test performance. The glutaraldehyde clot test is performed as in foals, with no clot formation at 60 min indicating failure of passive transfer.  Measurement of serum total protein by refractometer is a fairly reliable indicator of adequate passive transfer in healthy, well-hydrated calves. A level of 5.2 g/dL is roughly equivalent to an IgG concentration of 1,000 mg/dL.  A commercially available ELISA test kit uses serum as the sample and takes ~20 min. The assay is qualitative in that it indicates an IgG concentration of >1,000 mg/dL or < 1,000 mg/dL. Sensitivity and specificity are reasonably good, and this test is less influenced by factors such as calf dehydration or reagent instability than some other methods. Manufacturer recommendations for storing and using the kits must be followed.

Fecal examination makes up a large part of laboratory diagnostic testing for parasitic infection. Detection of a wide range of endoparasites infecting small animals is possible through the use of various fecal examination techniques.   Fecal examination techniques are noninvasive and relatively inexpensive, making them among the most cost-effective diagnostic tests available. Fecal samples should be as fresh as possible.  Dog owners should be instructed to submit only samples collected immediately after deposit (to be certain the sample came from their own dog).  Cat owners should clean the litter box and then collect the next available sample.  Samples should be collected in leakproof, sealable plastic containers. If samples cannot be submitted within 2 hours of collection, they should be refrigerated at 4°C.   Samples exposed to soil or grass for extended lengths of time are unsuitable because they could have been invaded by free-living nematodes.   Samples incubated at room temperature for > 6 hours are unsuitable because it takes < 6 hours for helminth eggs to develop and hatch and for protozoal trophozoites or cysts to degrade.   Immature parasite stages can be sporadically shed in the feces of an infected animal. Therefore, for animals showing clinical signs that suggest parasitic infection, a single negative fecal examination result is insufficient to rule out parasitism.   To rule out parasitism, examinations should be conducted on three samples collected either on consecutive days or over 7–10 days.  Pearls & Pitfalls  To rule out parasitism, examinations should be conducted on three samples collected either on consecutive days or over 7–10 days.  False-positive results are possible with all of the fecal examination methods because of coprophagia (dogs) and hunting (cats, dogs).  A dog that ingests feces containing helminth eggs, protozoal cysts, or nematode larvae from an infected animal will shed those parasites in its feces over the next several days.  A cat or dog that hunts will shed in its feces the immature stages of any parasite that is in a prey animal it eats for several days after feeding on that animal.  Examination of Feces for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals The most widely used fecal examination methods are simple flotation and centrifugal flotation. Other methods include direct smear, simple sedimentation, Baermann examination, and ELISA. Each of these additional methods is preferred for certain indications, as detailed below.  Simple Fecal Flotation Simple flotation is often done with commercial kits (see simple fecal flotation kit image), in which a small amount of feces is mixed with a high-specific-gravity (1.18–1.33) salt or sugar flotation solution in a chamber. The specific instructions for the commercial kit should be followed. In general, the instructions for these kits are a variation of the following:  A small amount of feces is placed in the bottom of the chamber.  The chamber is half filled with flotation medium.  The insert is placed in the chamber and rotated back and forth one-quarter turn for 20–30 seconds to mix the feces with the flotation medium.  The insert is firmly snapped into place in the chamber.  The chamber is completely filled with flotation medium to form a positive meniscus.  A coverslip or slide is added on top.  The sample is allowed to sit for 5–10 minutes. The parasite stages are concentrated as they float up to the surface of the flotation medium and attach to the slide or coverslip.  The coverslip is then placed on a glass slide and examined under the microscope using the 10X objective to identify the parasites.  Simple fecal flotation kit   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal Fecal Flotation Detection sensitivity of fecal flotation is greatly improved if centrifugation is added (see centrifuge image). In general, centrifugal flotation is far superior to simple flotation for detecting parasites. The most dramatic example is the detection of the bipolar-plugged eggs of whipworms or capillarids.  Pearls & Pitfalls  In general, centrifugal flotation is far superior to simple flotation for detecting parasites.  Fecal flotation tubes in centrifuge   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal flotation is conducted as follows:  Approximately 1 teaspoon of feces (3–5 g) is mixed in flotation medium, sieved through cheesecloth or a tea strainer, poured into a test tube, and centrifuged at 650 g for 10 minutes.  Flotation medium is then added to completely fill the test tube (forming a positive meniscus),  A coverslip is added, and the sample is allowed to sit for 5–20 minutes.  The coverslip is placed on a microscope slide, and the entire area under the coverslip is systematically examined, using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  Most helminth eggs and protozoal cysts are detected by centrifugal flotation (see dog sample and sheep sample images). Protozoal trophozoites, nematode larvae, spirurid eggs, acanthocephalan eggs, and operculate eggs (trematodes, Diphyllobothrium spp, Spirometra mansonoides) are not reliably detected by flotation methods.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Protozoal trophozoites, nematode larvae, spirurid eggs, acanthocephalan eggs, and operculate eggs are not reliably detected by flotation methods.  Centrifugal fecal flotation sample, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Centrifugal fecal flotation sample, sheep   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Various flotation media are available for use. Sugar flotation medium has the advantage of not crystallizing as readily as salt solutions do; therefore, slides prepared with sugar medium can be stored for a few days in the refrigerator if there is a need to reexamine the slide or consult with a colleague.  For use in small animal diagnostics, centrifugal flotation using zinc sulfate (ZnSO4; specific gravity 1.18) is considered the best option for detecting Giardia duodenalis cysts.  Direct Smear The simplest and most inexpensive fecal examination test is the direct smear. A tiny speck of feces (on the end of an applicator stick) is mixed in a drop of saline solution on a microscope slide, and the slide is examined under a microscope. Care must be taken not to mix in too much fecal matter (print should be easily visible through the preparation if placed on a book). Turning down (partially closing) the condenser on the microscope helps decrease brightness and increases contrast, typically making it easier to see unstained parasite ova or trophozoites.  Direct smear is the method of choice for detecting protozoal trophozoites such as G duodenalis and Tritrichomonas blagburni. When these parasites are suspected, direct smears should be done on very fresh feces (within 20 minutes of deposit) because the trophozoites die and become unrecognizable very quickly after feces are passed by an infected animal.  All of the parasites listed above that are not reliably detected by centrifugal flotation can be diagnosed by direct smear; however, false-negative results are common because such a small amount of feces is examined.  Simple Sedimentation Simple sedimentation is the method of choice for detecting operculate eggs. The test is simple to set up but relatively time-consuming to perform:  A small amount of fecal matter (1–2 g) is mixed with water and passed through a coarse sieve (cheesecloth or tea strainer).  The fecal-water solution is poured into a test tube and left to stand upright in a rack for 5 minutes.  The supernatant is poured off, the tube is refilled with clean water, the sediment is resuspended by stirring with an applicator, and the tube is left to stand for another 5 minutes.  This sequence is repeated a third time, during which the supernatant is poured off and the small amount of remaining fluid and sediment are examined microscopically (several drops placed on a slide with a coverslip added).  Because of the time required to examine a sedimentation sample, this test should be reserved for cases in which an animal has clinical signs that suggest infection with a parasite that has eggs not reliably detected by centrifugal flotation.  Simple sedimentation is the method of choice for the operculate eggs of trematodes (Alaria spp, Cryptocotyle lingua, Nanophyetus salmincola, Paragonimus kellicotti, Platynosomum illiciens) and pseudophyllidean cestodes (Diphyllobothrium spp, S mansonoides).  When infection by the blood fluke Heterobilharzia americana is suspected, saline solution must be used instead of water for the sedimentation procedure. Water induces the eggs to hatch and release the ciliated miracidia, which would be lost with the supernatant, giving false-negative test results.  Simple sedimentation is also recommended for detecting the eggs of spirurid worms (Physaloptera spp) or acanthocephalans (eg, Onicola canis), neither of which are reliably detected by flotation methods.  Baermann Examination Baermann examination is the method of choice for detecting nematode larvae (ie, lungworms and Strongyloides stercoralis). The test is simple to set up; however, accurate identification of nematode larvae tends to be challenging.  Extra care must be taken to ensure that the client has collected only fresh samples (ie, fecal matter collected and submitted within 2 hours of deposit or refrigerated immediately after collection and stored for no longer than 2–3 days before submission). In addition, the shedding of larvae in feces tends to be sporadic in animals infected with lungworms, increasing the chances of a false-negative result. Therefore, three Baermann examinations of samples collected on 3 consecutive days or every 2–3 days might be necessary to detect infections.  Baermann examination requires a glass funnel with tubing attached, a clamp, a funnel rack, cheesecloth, and hot tap water (see Baermann examination setup image):  With the clamp securely in place and closing off the tubing, the funnel is half-filled with hot tap water (not too hot to touch without gloves).  Approximately 10–20 g of fresh feces is placed in a double layer of cheesecloth, and an applicator stick is pushed through the cheesecloth corners to form a sling around the fecal sample.  The cheesecloth-wrapped sample is placed in the water and left to sit for at least 8 hours.  With care taken not to spill any of the first drops, the clamp is gently released, and the fluid is caught in a 15-mL test tube.  The tube is centrifuged (650 g, 10 minutes), the supernatant is discarded, and the few remaining drops and sediment are examined by placing a drop on a microscope slide and adding a coverslip.  Baermann examination setup   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Nematode larvae are usually fairly active, moving vigorously, so they are relatively easy to see under the microscope's 10X objective. Once detected, the larvae should be killed to examine them in detail for accurate identification. The larvae might be killed simply by placing a drop of dilute iodine (approximately the color of tea) at the edge of the coverslip and allowing it to wick across the parasites under the coverslip.  Baermann examination is the method of choice for detecting intestinal infections caused by S stercoralis (in dogs) and cardiorespiratory infections caused by Aelurostrongylus abstrusus (in cats), Angiostrongylus vasorum (in dogs), and Crenosoma vulpis (in dogs).  Baermann examination is not the method of choice for identifying infections caused by Filaroides hirthi or Oslerus osleri in dogs. The larvae of these two pathogens lack the vigor and motility necessary to swim from the fecal sample out into warm water; therefore, they are not reliably detected by Baermann examination.  For F hirthi and O osleri in dogs, microscopic examination of saliva, sputum, or samples from transtracheal wash or bronchoalveolar lavage is recommended instead. Bronchoscopy also can be used to identify the large wartlike nodules of O osleri at the bifurcation of the trachea.  Immunological Tests A commercially available fecal ELISA can be used to test for G duodenalis infection in dogs and cats. It is accurate and more sensitive than a single ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation examination performed by an experienced laboratory diagnostician.  A single ELISA is approximately equivalent to performing three ZnSO4 centrifugal flotation examinations. This ELISA does not require the skill level and experience that are necessary for an accurate morphological diagnosis.  One disadvantage of ELISA is expense: it detects only one pathogen, whereas fecal flotation can detect multiple parasites. In addition, ELISA produces positive results for a prolonged period of time in animals that have been treated, have recovered, and no longer appear to be shedding cysts in the feces. Therefore, it is not suitable for posttreatment monitoring or when a dog must test negative to reenter a canine day care facility.  Pearls & Pitfalls  ELISA remains positive for prolonged periods, so it is not suitable for posttreatment monitoring or when a dog must test negative to reenter a canine day care facility.  In cats with tritrichomoniasis, although the trophozoites of T blagburni are readily detected by direct smear, they cannot be differentiated from those of the nonpathogenic Pentatrichomonas spp. Definitive diagnosis requires the culturing of feces, followed by PCR assay.  Examination of Urine for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals The eggs of Pearsonema plica (syn Capillaria plica) and Dioctophyme renale might be detected in the sediment during urinalysis of dogs.  The eggs of P plica are bipolar plugged and contain a single embryo cell. The eggs of D renale have a thick shell wall, are slightly larger, and contain a two-celled embryo.  The bipolar-plugged eggs of Pearsonema feliscati (syn Capillaria feliscati) can be detected in the urine of cats.  Examination of Saliva-Sputum for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals See the discussion of F hirthi and O osleri under Baermann Examination above.  Examination of Blood for Internal Parasite Diagnosis in Small Animals Blood samples are examined to detect infection by heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis) and various bloodborne protozoal parasites (eg, Babesia spp, Cytauxzoon felis, Hepatozoon canis).  Testing for Heartworm Currently, both an antigen detection test and a microfilaria test are recommended for the laboratory diagnosis of heartworm infection in dogs.  Various commercial antigen test options are available for detecting D immitis infection in dogs and cats. These tests detect circulating adult female antigens and are recommended for use in animals that were exposed at least 7 months before testing.  The tests are so accurate and sensitive that clinicians can easily forget that both false-negative and false-positive results are still possible. Previously, false-negatives were thought to occur only if the animal was tested too soon after exposure (ie, before 7 months) or if very few female worms were present. It is now recognized that some dogs test negative even when a large worm burden is present, because the antigen can be sequestered in antibody-antigen complexes.  The current recommendation of doing both an antigen test and a microfilaria test achieves the greatest detection sensitivity. The microfilaria tests with the highest detection sensitivity are the modified Knott's test and the filter test. Both tests examine anticoagulated blood, mixed with formalin and dyed with methylene blue, to enable identification of microfilariae on a microscope slide, as outlined here:  Modified Knott's test:  1 mL of anticoagulated blood (EDTA or heparin) is added to 9 mL of 2% formalin in a 15-mL test tube.  The blood is immediately mixed with the formalin by inverting the test tube up and down 5–6 times.  The sample is centrifuged (173 g for 5 minutes).  The supernatant is poured off.  1–2 drops of 0.1% methylene blue are added, and the sediment is resuspended into the dye by stirring with an applicator stick.  The solution is pipetted onto a slide, coverslipped, and examined using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  The entire volume of the 0.1% methylene blue–sediment mixture is microscopically examined.  Filter test:  1 mL of anticoagulated blood (EDTA or heparin) is added to 9 mL of 2% formalin in a syringe.  The blood is immediately mixed with the formalin by inverting the syringe up and down 5–6 times  The syringe is attached to a filter holder containing a 25-mm filter with a 5-mcm pore size.  The plunger is depressed, pushing the entire mixture through the filter.  The syringe is refilled with water, and the water mixture is pushed through the filter.  The syringe is refilled with air, and the air is pushed through the filter.  The filter holder is unscrewed, and the filter is removed with a forceps and placed on a microscope slide (syringe side up).  One drop of 0.1% methylene blue is added, and the sample is coverslipped and examined using the 10X objective of a compound microscope.  Note that 25–33% of infected dogs have no circulating microfilariae, making the infection undetectable by these tests.  Besides containing D immitis microfilariae, canine blood samples in North America might also contain microfilariae of the nonpathogenic, subcutaneous-dwelling worm Acanthocheilonema reconditum (formerly Dipetalonema reconditum). The microfilariae of D immitis and A reconditum can be differentiated by size and morphology using the modified Knott's test (see Knott's test sample image). They cannot be differentiated with the filter test.  Modified Knott’s test sample, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Less sensitive methods of detection are the direct blood smear (drop of blood placed on a slide, covered with a coverslip, and examined for microfilariae) and the hematocrit tube test (blood is centrifuged, and the buffy coat is examined microscopically as microfilariae migrate into the plasma). In addition, microfilariae can be detected on a dried blood smear stained with Wright-Giemsa stain.  Diagnosis of heartworm infection in cats is based on a combination of the antigen test and an antibody test. The antigen tests are less useful in cats than in dogs because of the lower worm burdens that typically occur in cats.  Available for use in cats, antibody tests detect circulating antibody and therefore detect exposure. Both tests of cats that are currently infected and of cats that have been exposed in the past give positive results. Because infected cats rarely have circulating microfilariae, microfilaria tests are not recommended for use in cats.  Testing for Bloodborne Protozoa The bloodborne protozoal parasites Babesia spp, Cytauxzoon felis, and Hepatozoon canis can be detected on dried, Giemsa-stained hematology blood smears and by immunological and molecular methods.  Parasitemia is the most pronounced in the acute phase of the infection and therefore can be detected on stained blood smears. As infections become more chronic, parasitemia might not be present, necessitating immunological methods (ELISA, immunofluorescence assay, indirect hemagglutination assay) or molecular methods.  Morphological Identification To achieve the expertise necessary for making accurate morphological identification of various immature parasite stages requires a high level of training and experience. A very subjective acquired skill, it requires the ability to recognize and evaluate subtle morphological characteristics. An extremely valuable tool that adds objective data to morphological assessment of parasite stages is an ocular micrometer.  An ocular micrometer is a small scale that fits into the eyepiece of the compound microscope and is calibrated for each objective of the microscope. It allows the user to measure the size of each parasite found on the slide, thereby facilitating accurate characterization and diagnosis. It is relatively inexpensive and can be easily moved to another microscope as needed. Ocular micrometers can be purchased from any microscope dealer.  Internal Parasite (Endoparasite) Diagnosis in Horses and Production Animals Fresh fecal samples from production animals should be collected from pasture, barn, or, preferably, the animal's rectum using plastic gloves. Samples should be placed in a properly identified, sealed specimen jar. Samples > 6 hours old are unsuitable for the same reasons that are stated above for pet fecal sample collection.\n","Successfully saved 'clinical_hematology.txt' to Google Drive\n","add another file? (y/n): y\n","Enter the filenamecirculatory_system\n","Paste textA representative number of herd samples should be collected from a minimum of 10 animals to account for the typical high individual variation in the number of eggs shed. Samples can be combined after thorough mixing to enable examination of a single composite sample for the herd.  Refrigeration is important for sample integrity; unless refrigerated, helminth eggs can develop and hatch in samples collected in the morning and not returned to the laboratory until the end of the day.  The same qualitative fecal examination methods described above for small animals are used in horses and production animals.  Quantitative fecal egg count (FEC) methods are also used in large animal practice. FECs are a necessary tool for the early detection of anthelmintic resistance, and they are the cornerstone upon which selective programs in equine parasite control are based.  The Cornell-Wisconsin (double-centrifugation)and McMaster methods are available for obtaining FECs in production animals. The mini-FLOTAC device is a newer apparatus for fecal egg detection that is now commercially available in the US.  The Cornell-Wisconsin double-centrifugation technique is the most sensitive FEC method and should be used only when relatively low counts are expected (as with adult cattle or camelids). At counts of > 100 eggs per gram (EPG), counting fatigue negatively affects FEC accuracy. In such situations, more accurate counts will be achieved using a dilution method such as the McMaster count.  The mini-FLOTAC procedure is more sensitive than the McMaster method; however, it is also more time-consuming.  In ruminants, these FEC methods can be used to estimate relative infection burden for nematodes of the “GI parasite complex” (eg, trichostrongylid eggs of cattle), while also detecting coccidia and other parasites, such as tapeworms. In horses, FECs are used mainly to quantify fecal shedding of strongylid eggs.  The Cornell-Wisconsin method consists of the following steps:  Three grams of fecal matter is placed in a container, suspended in approximately 15 mL of water, strained through a gauze square into a 15-mL tube, and centrifuged (270 g, 10 minutes).  The supernatant is poured off, and the sediment is mixed with saturated sugar solution, filling the tube enough to form a positive meniscus before a 22 × 22-mm coverslip is placed on the lip of the test tube.  The tube is centrifuged again at low speed (270 g, 5 minutes).  The coverslip, with the surface film containing eggs, is removed and transferred to a microscope slide to count trichostrongylid eggs in cattle, sheep, goat, or camelid feces.  The total is divided by 3 to derive the EPG.  Other parasites are noted, if present, and assigned a general abundance designation of +1 (few), +2 (small number), +3 (large number), or +4 (too numerous to count).  When FECs are likely to be high (> 100 EPG), the McMaster or mini-FLOTAC method is recommended. Both methods use a calibrated slide or chamber and sugar flotation medium. A saturated solution of table salt (specific gravity 1.20) is an inexpensive alternative medium for diagnosing production animal parasites; however, salt can be highly corrosive to metal surfaces. Magnesium sulfate (specific gravity 1.20) is the preferred medium for swine feces.  McMaster slides contain two chambers with etched areas of known volume (see McMaster slide image) that are used to estimate the EPG and are frequently used for FECs in horses and small ruminants. The McMaster method proceeds as follows:  Fecal matter (4 g) mixed with sugar flotation medium (56 mL) is strained (through cheesecloth or tea strainer).  After thorough mixing, the solution is introduced into each chamber with a Pasteur pipette.  The eggs within the marked grid are counted under low-power magnification (10X objective).  McMaster egg-counting slide   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Each chamber of the McMaster slide has a volume of 0.15 mL under the etched grid. Because two chambers are examined, 0.3 mL is evaluated from the total sample volume of 60 mL (ie, the total sample is 200 times greater than the portion examined). For example, if 4 g of fecal matter is mixed with 56 mL of sugar solution, then each egg counted is multiplied by 50 (ie, the factor of 200 noted above, divided by 4 g of feces in the original sample) to yield the EPG in the fecal sample (ie, the sensitivity is 50 EPG). In horses, the sensitivity can be increased to 25 EPG by using 4 g of feces in half the volume (26 mL) of sugar solution; the total number of eggs counted on the slide (in chambers 1 and 2) is still multiplied by 50 to yield the EPG.  Acceptable correlation between the EPG and the relative worm burden is often possible in young animals; adult animals, however, typically have low (< 5 EPG) or zero counts.  In young cattle, which generally have EPG counts 10 times higher than those of adult animals, EPG counts > 50 reflect a moderate infection, and EPG counts > 500 indicate a heavy burden and a need for treatment. There is no consensus on the exact number; however, treatment thresholds of ≥ 250 EPG are often used for strongyle control programs in horses. For sheep and goats, an EPG count > 5,000 is considered high and warrants treatment.  Because fluke eggs do not float readily, quantitative fecal sedimentation procedures are usually used:  Two grams of fecal matter is mixed with 35 mL of soapy solution (2% liquid detergent) and strained through gauze into a 50-mL centrifuge tube.  The tube is filled with soapy water and allowed to stand for 3 minutes, after which half of the supernatant is discarded.  This procedure is repeated two or three times, until the supernatant is clean.  All but 15 mL is poured off, and two drops of new methylene blue are added.  The eggs are counted with a dissecting microscope in a gridded Petri dish or by examining several coverslipped microscope slides of the new methylene blue mixture.  The eggs of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica can be differentiated from those of Paramphistomum rumen flukes by their golden color, more distinct barrel shape, and slightly greater size, compared with the gray color, more pointy end, and lesser size of the usually nonpathogenic rumen fluke eggs. Commercial sieve-sediment kits can decrease sample preparation time by 50%.  In cattle, Fasciola EPG counts of > 3 suggest economic losses, and an EPG count of > 10 might be associated with clinical signs. Overview of Hematopoietic System in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (0) Videos (0) The hematopoietic system is the organ system comprising the blood and tissues responsible for blood cell generation through the process of hematopoiesis (see figure illustrating normal hematopoiesis).  Normal hematopoiesis   Image Courtesy of Teton NewMedia.  The cellular elements of blood deliver oxygen to cells (RBCs), protect against foreign organisms and antigens (WBCs), and initiate coagulation (platelets), whereas the noncellular component of blood (plasma) supplies cells with water, electrolytes, nutrients, and hormones and removes waste products.  Because of the hematopoietic system's diversity, its diseases are best discussed from a functional perspective. Functions can be classified as either appropriate responses to abnormal situations (eg, leukocytosis and left shift in response to inflammation) or primary abnormalities of the hematopoietic system (eg, pancytopenia from bone marrow dysfunction). Furthermore, abnormalities can be quantitative (ie, too many or too few cells) or qualitative (ie, abnormalities in function). (Also see The Biology of the Immune System.) Red Blood Cells in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Key Points | For More Information Erythrocytes (RBCs) are largely produced from hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow.  In most mammals, mature RBCs have a biconcave disk shape and lack a nucleus. Nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs), or erythroblasts, are immature RBCs that have not undergone nuclear extrusion and still contain a nucleus. Camelid RBCs are elliptical. Mature RBCs in birds are large oval cells containing oval nuclei.  The function of RBCs is to carry oxygen to tissues at pressures sufficient to permit its rapid diffusion. This process requires the following biological elements:  a carrier molecule (hemoglobin)  a vehicle (RBCs) capable of bringing intact hemoglobin (Hgb) to cells  a metabolism geared to protect both RBCs and Hgb from damage  Interference with synthesis or release of Hgb, production or survival of RBCs, or metabolism can cause disease.  Hgb is a complex molecule, formed of 4 heme units attached to 4 globins (2 alpha and 2 beta globins). Iron is added in the last step of erythropoiesis by the ferrochelatase enzyme.  Interference with normal production of heme or globin (such as with lead poisoning or deficiency of copper or iron) leads to anemia.  Hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease, important genetic diseases of humans, have not been observed in other animals. In these diseases, production of globins (alpha, beta, or both) does not balance heme production, and Hgb is not functional.  The only known naturally occurring hemoglobinopathy of animals is porphyria. Although described in several species, porphyria is most important as a cause of photosensitivity in cattle.  RBC mass, and thus oxygen-carrying capacity, remains constant over time in healthy animals. A decreased RBC mass (anemia) can be caused by blood loss, excess destruction of RBCs (hemolysis), or decreased production of RBCs.  Once produced in bone marrow, mature RBCs have a finite lifespan in circulation before senescent RBCs are destroyed. RBC production and destruction must be carefully balanced to avoid both anemia and erythrocytosis (excess RBCs in circulation).  Erythropoiesis (RBC production) is regulated by erythropoietin, a hormone that increases in the presence of hypoxia. Erythropoietin acts on bone marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, shorten maturation time, and cause early release of reticulocytes (immature RBCs).  In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production. Chronic kidney disease can be associated with anemia in later stages, as the kidneys fail to produce this vital hormone in sufficient amounts.  Nutrient deficiency (eg, of iron, folate, or vitamin B12) can also suppress erythropoiesis, as can chronic debilitating diseases, inflammatory diseases, and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism, or hyperestrogenism).  Toxic insult, infectious diseases (eg, feline leukemia virus disease, histoplasmosis), and neoplasms within bone marrow (eg, myelofibrosis) can all primarily affect the bone marrow, leading to decreased erythropoiesis with or without other cytopenias. Each of the conditions mentioned here would be expected to cause nonregenerative anemia.  To balance RBC production, two mechanisms exist for removal of senescent RBCs: intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. Both conserve the principal constituents of the cell for reuse.  Removal of aged RBCs normally occurs by phagocytosis by fixed macrophages in the spleen. As RBCs age, they change antigenically, acquiring senescent antigens and losing flexibility because of impaired ATP production. Both of these changes increase the chance that the cells will become trapped in the spleen and removed by macrophages.  After phagocytosis and subsequent disruption of the cell membrane, Hgb is converted to heme and globin. Iron is released from the heme moiety and either stored in the macrophage as ferritin or hemosiderin or released into the circulation for transport back to the marrow. The remaining heme is converted to bilirubin, which is released by macrophages into the systemic circulation, where it complexes with albumin for transport to hepatocytes. In the liver, it is conjugated and excreted into the bile.  This normal process of extravascular hemolysis of aged RBCs occurs at a low rate every day, thereby accounting for the low bilirubin concentrations measurable in blood in healthy animals. In diseases causing excess extravascular hemolysis, RBCs may be destroyed before they are senescent, resulting in a shortened RBC lifespan, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia.  In animals in good health, approximately 1% of aging RBCs are hemolyzed within circulation (intravascular hemolysis) instead of within the spleen. In this process, free Hgb is released and quickly converted to Hgb dimers that bind to haptoglobin and are transported to the liver. There, they are metabolized in the same manner as products from RBCs removed by phagocytosis.  In diseases causing excess intravascular hemolysis, increased numbers of RBCs are destroyed in the circulation, releasing hemoglobin at a rate that exceeds haptoglobin's binding capacity. This process results in excess hemoglobinemia, which may be detectable as hemolyzed-looking serum. Excess Hgb and, therefore, iron are excreted in the urine (hemoglobinuria).  The principal metabolic pathway of RBCs is glycolysis, and the main energy source for this in most species is glucose. Glucose enters RBCs by an insulin-independent mechanism, and most is metabolized to produce ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The energy of ATP is used to fuel RBC membrane pumps that work to preserve cell shape and flexibility.  The reducing potential of NADH is utilized via the methemoglobin reductase pathway to maintain iron in Hgb in its reduced form (Fe2+). Glucose not used in glycolysis is metabolized via a second pathway, the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt, which does not produce energy but is important for maintaining the sulfhydryl groups of globin in their reduced state.  These metabolic pathways are key for the survival and functionality of RBCs as they circulate. Some anemic disorders are the direct result of abnormal RBC metabolism and interference with glycolysis.  Inherited deficiency of pyruvate kinase, a key glycolytic enzyme, causes ATP deficiency, which leads to decreased RBC lifespan and hemolytic anemia.  Excessive oxidant stress can overload the protective HMP shunt or methemoglobin reductase pathways, causing Heinz body hemolysis or methemoglobin formation, respectively. Hemolytic anemia caused by acetaminophen toxicity in cats is an example.  While anemia can be caused by RBC loss (bleeding or excess hemolysis) or lack of production, absolute erythrocytosis, by contrast, is generally the result of excess RBC production rather than failure to clear senescent RBCs.  Erythrocytosis can be a primary problem of the bone marrow (polycythemia vera) or a secondary problem, resulting from dysfunction outside of the bone marrow.  When secondary, erythrocytosis may be an appropriate, compensatory response to try to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in chronic hypoxic states (eg, pulmonary disease, right-to-left intracardiac shunts), or it may be an inappropriate response, as is the case with erythropoietin-producing neoplasms.  Relative erythrocytosis is the term used to describe increased RBC mass relative to plasma, which most commonly results from dehydration (hemoconcentration) or splenic contraction.  Key Points RBC production is regulated by the hormone erythropoietin, which is released as needed by the kidneys.  Senescent RBCs are removed primarily by macrophages in the spleen.  Anemia is caused by blood loss, excess hemolysis, or decreased production of RBCs. White Blood Cells in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Phagocytes | Lymphocytes | Key Points | For More Information Major types of circulating WBCs, or leukocytes, include neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These WBC types can be further classified according to specific characteristics.  Granulocytes are characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic granules (specialized secretory vesicles containing various cytotoxic molecules, enzymes, and peptides). Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes that have lobulated nuclei and are classified according to the staining characteristics of their cytoplasmic granules as neutral (neutrophils), red or pink (eosinophils), or lavender or purple (basophils). Mast cells are another type of granulocytic leukocyte that has a round, rather than lobulated, purple nucleus.  Some veterinary species (eg, rabbits and guinea pigs) have a WBC type called heterophils. Heterophils are analogous to neutrophils in other species but have eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. Cytologically, they can be difficult to distinguish from eosinophils. The cellular equivalents to neutrophils in birds and reptiles are also called heterophils and have eosinophilic granules.  Phagocytes are characterized by participation in phagocytosis, the process of engulfing and destroying particles such as invading microorganisms or debris. Neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells are considered professional phagocytes, while other types of cells may participate in phagocytosis to a lesser extent.  Cells can also be classified according to the shape of their nucleus. Mature neutrophils, as well as eosinophils and basophils, have a segmented nucleus and thus are known as polymorphonuclear cells. This is in contrast to mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and macrophages) as well as lymphocytes, which prototypically have a round nucleus. However, monocytes can sometimes have a pseudolobulated nucleus, resembling that of a neutrophil.  Band neutrophils are a type of immature neutrophil distinguished from mature neutrophils by a lack of clear segmentation in the shape of the nucleus. Other neutrophil precursors include myelocytes and metamyelocytes, which are classified by their stage of maturation.  Reptiles have a type of mononuclear cell, thought to be a monocyte variant, called an azurophil. Birds, in contrast, lack azurophils.   Mononuclear phagocytes arise primarily from bone marrow and are released into blood as monocytes. They can circulate for up to a few days before entering tissues and differentiating into macrophages.  Neutrophils circulate for only a few hours before traveling to tissues. (See also Physiology of Leukocytes in Animals.)  Phagocytes in Animals The principal function of phagocytes is to defend against invading microorganisms by ingesting and destroying them, thus contributing to cellular inflammatory responses.  The process of phagocytosis can be divided into five distinct stages:  Attraction of phagocytes (chemotaxis) to microorganisms, antigen-antibody complexes, and other inflammatory mediators  Attachment to the organism  Ingestion  Fusion of cell lysosomes with ingested microorganisms and bacterial killing  Digestion  In addition, many phagocytes have other specialized functions.  Functions of the immune system can be divided broadly into the innate immune system, which is rapid but nonspecific, and the adaptive immune system, which is slower but more specific toward specific pathogenic stimuli. The adaptive immune system can be further divided into cellular and humoral components. There is substantial cross-talk among these functional units of the immune system.  Monocytes form a link to the adaptive immune system by processing antigen for presentation to lymphocytes and by producing substances such as IL-1, which initiates fever and lymphocyte activation and stimulates the development of early hematopoietic progenitors.  Eosinophils, while having a role as phagocytes, also have more specific functions that include defending against metazoan parasites and modulating the inflammatory process. They respond chemotactically to histamine, immune complexes, and eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, a substance released by degranulating mast cells.  Basophils are not true phagocytes but contain large amounts of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.  Eosinophilia and basophilia may occur in response to systemic allergic reactions and to tissue invasion by parasites.  As with RBCs, production and circulating numbers of phagocytes are tightly regulated and controlled by various humoral factors, including colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.  Unlike RBCs, which remain circulating in blood, phagocytes use this compartment as a pathway to tissues. Consequently, the number of phagocytes in blood reflects circumstances in the tissues (eg, inflammation) as well as the proliferative function of bone marrow. The sensitivity with which phagocytes respond to these conditions varies from species to species.  While neutrophilia is most commonly expected with tissue inflammation and infection, neutropenia can occur with overwhelming tissue demand, and some cases of neutropenia in dogs may be immune mediated. Regardless of the cause, severe neutropenia is likely to result in bacterial infection.  Finally, phagocyte precursors may undergo malignant transformation, which results in acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Lymphocytes in Animals Lymphocytes are responsible for both humoral and cellular immunity. Cells of these two branches of the immune system cannot be differentiated morphologically; however, they differ in their dynamics of production and circulation.  Lymphocyte production in mammals originates in bone marrow. Some lymphocytes destined to be involved in cellular immunity migrate to the thymus and differentiate further under the influence of thymic hormones. These become T cells and are responsible for a variety of helper or cytotoxic immunological functions. Most circulating lymphocytes are T cells, but T cells are also present in spleen and lymph nodes.  B cells, on the other hand, migrate directly to organs without undergoing modification in the thymus and are responsible for humoral immunity (antibody production). (See also Physiology of Leukocytes in Animals.)  Thus, lymphoid organs have populations of both B and T lymphocytes. In lymph nodes, follicular centers are primarily comprised of B cells, while parafollicular zones are primarily comprised of T cells. In the spleen, most lymphocytes of the red pulp are B cells, whereas those of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths are T cells. Close association of T cells and B cells within lymphoid organs is essential to immune function.  Lymphocyte function in the cellular immune system features both afferent (receptor) and efferent (effector) components. Long-lived T cells of the peripheral blood are receptors. In response to antigens to which they have been previously sensitized, they leave the circulation and undergo blast transformation to form activated T cells, which in turn cause other T cells to undergo blast transformation, both locally and systemically. Stimulated T cells produce lymphokines with a wide range of activities, such as attraction and activation of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes.  The humoral immune system is composed of B cells that produce several classes of antibodies. When sensitized B cells encounter antigen, they divide and differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody. Therefore, each initially stimulated B cell produces a clone of plasma cells, all producing the same specific antibody.  Antibody molecules (immunoglobulins) fall into several classes, each with its own functional characteristics:  IgA is the principal antibody of respiratory and intestinal secretions.  IgM is the first antibody produced in response to a newly recognized antigen.  IgG is the principal antibody in circulating blood.  IgE is the principal antibody involved in allergic reactions.  Antibodies perform their functions by combining with specific antigens that stimulated their production. Antigen-antibody complexes can be chemotactic for phagocytes, or they can activate complement, a process that produces both cell lysis and substances chemotactic for neutrophils and macrophages. In this manner, the humoral immune system is related to, and interacts with, the innate immune system.  The humoral immune system is also related to both the innate immune system and the cellular immune system in other ways. Both helper (CD4) and cytotoxic (CD8)T-cell classes have been described:  Helper T cells recognize processed antigen and activate the humoral immune response.  Cytotoxic T cells, after sensitization by antigen, are effector cells, which are especially important in antiviral immunity.  Natural killer cells, a class of lymphocyte distinct from T cells and B cells, destroy foreign cells (eg, neoplastic cells), even without prior sensitization.  Antigen processing by macrophages precedes recognition of an antigen by lymphocytes. These complex processes are involved in routine surveillance against neoplastic cells and recognition of normal “self” cells.  Lymphocyte response in disease may be appropriate (activation of the immune system to defend against microorganisms) or inappropriate (immune-mediated disease and lymphoproliferative malignancies). (Also see The Biology of the Immune System.)  Immune-mediated disease results from the immune system's failure to recognize host tissues as normal self cells. For example, in immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, antibodies are produced against the host’s own RBCs.  Another inappropriate immune system response is allergy. In allergic individuals, IgE antibodies against allergens bind to the surface of basophils and mast cells. When exposure to an allergen occurs, antigen-antibody complexes form, and degranulation of mast cells and basophils releases vasoactive amines. Reaction to this can be mild (as in urticaria or atopy) or life-threatening (as in anaphylaxis).  Lymphocytosis occurs in some species, especially cats, as a response to epinephrine secretion; lymphocytosis, therefore, may be nonspecific in this species and be accompanied by stress and a wide array of illnesses. Atypical lymphocytes may be present in the blood in response to antigenic stimulation (eg, vaccination). Persistent lymphocytosis in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus is a benign polyclonal increase in lymphocyte numbers.  Lymphoproliferative malignancies include lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Lymphopenia may occur most commonly in response to glucocorticoid secretion (stress, illness, hyperadrenocorticism) or exogenous corticosteroid medications. (See also Leukogram Abnormalities in Animals.)  Key Points Phagocytes include granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), which circulate briefly, enter tissues, and have a short lifespan, and monocytes, which can persist for a long time in tissues as macrophages.  T lymphocytes may be helper (CD4) T cells, which process antigens and interact with humoral antibody production, or cytotoxic (CD8) T cells, which act, when sensitized, against specific antigens.  B lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies.  Natural killer lymphocytes destroy foreign cells (eg, neoplastic cells or those of transplanted organs). Platelets in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (3) Tables (0) Videos (0) Platelets form the initial hemostatic plug whenever hemorrhage occurs. They also are the source of phospholipid needed for the interaction of coagulation factors to form a fibrin clot. Hemostasis is therefore broadly divided into primary hemostasis, ending in the formation of a platelet plug; secondary hemostasis, ending in the formation of a fibrin clot; and tertiary hemostasis, or fibrinolysis, ending in resolution or lysis of the clot. (Also see Hemostatic Disorders in Animals.)  Platelets are produced in bone marrow from megakaryocytes, under the influence of the hormone thrombopoietin. Beginning with invagination of the megakaryocyte cell membrane, platelet production results from subsequent fragmentation of megakaryocytes into individual platelets. (See images of cat, horse, and cow platelets.)  In contrast, thrombocytes in birds (which do not have platelets) are small cells with a round nucleus.  Blood smear, platelets, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Blood smear, platelets, horse   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Blood smear, platelets, cow   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  When vessel walls are damaged, collagen and tissue factor are exposed. Circulating platelets adhere to the endothelium via von Willebrand factor, undergo a shape change, and release ADP. Local aggregation of more platelets is stimulated by ADP, resulting in the formation of a primary hemostatic plug—a platelet plug. Ultimately, local accumulation of fibrin and platelets is known as a fibrin clot, which is needed for effective hemostasis at injury sites.  Clot formation is a necessary protective mechanism to stop or prevent bleeding; however, conditions of inappropriate thrombosis (clot formation) can jeopardize health (see Thrombosis, Embolism, and Aneurysm in Animals).  Platelet disorders are either quantitative (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) or qualitative (thrombocytopathy).  Thrombocytopenia is one of the most common bleeding disorders of animals. In general, platelet counts must fall to < 30,000 platelets/mcL before the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage increases, though hemorrhage from minor trauma (venipuncture, cystocentesis) can occur with platelet counts in the range of 30,000–50,000 platelets/mcL. Spontaneous bleeding from severe thrombocytopenia (or thrombopathia) most commonly manifests as mucosal site (eg, gingiva, GI tract, urinary bladder, nasal passages, or eyes) bleeding or bruising (eg, petechiae, ecchymoses).  Consumption, destruction, or sequestration of platelets causes thrombocytopenia associated with increased platelet production by the bone marrow:  Consumptive thrombocytopenia occurs with massive hemorrhage or with DIC, secondary to a variety of diseases.  Destruction occurs in immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in which platelets become coated with antiplatelet antibodies and are removed from the circulation by the fixed phagocyte system.  Excessive sequestration of platelets by an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism) can occur in conditions such as myeloproliferative diseases.  Decreased production of platelets in the marrow can be caused by drugs, toxins, or primary marrow disorders such as aplasia, fibrosis, or hematopoietic malignancy. In primary marrow disorders, more than one hematopoietic cell line is often decreased, resulting in bicytopenia or pancytopenia.  Congenital macrothrombocytopenia is a hereditary disorder of platelet division during the maturation process. This disorder results in thrombocytopenia (decreased numbers of individual platelets) with preservation of overall platelet mass, as fewer, but larger, platelets are produced; pathological bleeding is uncommon with this disorder. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are commonly affected, and a genetic test is available.  Platelet activation during blood collection can cause platelets to clump; hematology analyzers can then provide erroneously low platelet counts, especially in cats. Blood film analysis to assess for platelet clumps is important in determining whether low machine-generated platelet counts are accurate.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Due to clumping, hematology analyzers can provide falsely low platelet counts, especially in cats.  Thrombocytopathies comprise a poorly defined group of diseases in which platelet numbers are normal but their function is impaired. Von Willebrand disease is characterized by a deficiency or malfunction of von Willebrand factor, which decreases platelet adhesion to the endothelium and impairs platelet plug formation. While von Willebrand disease is a primary hemostatic disorder that results in bleeding, platelets themselves are normal. Other hereditary disorders of platelet function have been described but are relatively rare.  Certain infections (feline leukemia virus, ehrlichiosis) and diseases (chronic kidney disease, liver failure) can also impair platelet function, in addition to disrupting the hematopoietic and coagulation systems in other ways. Aspirin administration causes a platelet function defect through its irreversible inhibition of thromboxane (which is necessary for platelet aggregation). Clopidogrel also irreversibly inhibits platelet function by binding an ADP receptor subtype necessary for platelet aggregation.  Thrombocytosis (increased platelet number) may be associated with primary marrow disease, such as in megakaryocytic leukemia (rare), chronic blood loss and iron deficiency, or chronic excess corticosteroid exposure (hyperadrenocorticism or exogenous corticosteroid medication).  Key Points Platelets are produced from megakaryocytes and form the first stage of coagulation (the hemostatic or platelet plug) when a blood vessel is damaged. Fibrin forms in the presence of aggregated platelets, leading to clot formation.  Bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia is often characterized by petechiae, ecchymoses, or mucosal bleeding.  Platelet function disorders are relatively rare and may be inherited or acquired. Overview of Anemia in Animals ByAllison Kendall, DVM, MS, DACVIM, North Carolina State University Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jul 2024 View the Pet Owner Version Anemia is an absolute decrease in RBC numbers, hemoglobin concentration, or PCV. Clinical signs include pale mucous membranes, increased heart rate, and hypotension. Diagnosis can be based on CBC but should be confirmed by additional tests. Treatment can be supportive but often requires addressing the underlying cause. Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (2) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Anemia can be due to loss, destruction, or lack of production of RBCs. On the basis of clinicopathological evidence of a compensatory response by the bone marrow, anemia can be classified as regenerative or nonregenerative (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia).  With regenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds appropriately to the decreased red cell mass by increasing RBC production and releasing reticulocytes. Anemia due to hemorrhage or hemolysis is typically regenerative. A regenerative response takes 3–5 days from the onset of anemia.  With nonregenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds inadequately to the increased need for RBCs. Anemia due to decreased erythropoietin or an abnormality in the bone marrow is nonregenerative. Anemia due to acute hemorrhage or hemolysis initially appears nonregenerative until there has been enough time for a regenerative response.  Pearls & Pitfalls  A regenerative response takes 3–5 days from the onset of anemia.  Table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia Clinical Findings of Anemia in Animals Clinical signs of anemia depend on the extent of the condition, the duration (acute or chronic), and the underlying cause.  Acute Anemia Acute anemia can result in shock and even death if more than a third of the blood volume is lost rapidly and not replaced. In acute blood loss, the following clinical signs are common:  tachycardia  pale mucous membranes  bounding or weak peripheral pulses  hypotension  The cause of the blood loss can be overt (eg, trauma) or occult. If no evidence of external bleeding is found, a source of internal or occult blood loss must be sought; examples include ruptured splenic tumor, other neoplasia, coagulopathy, GI ulceration, and parasites. Hemolysis can result in icterus.  Chronic Anemia Animals with chronic anemia have had time to accommodate, and their clinical presentation is usually more vague, with signs such as the following:  lethargy  weakness  anorexia  Patients with acute or chronic anemia can show similar clinical signs, such as pale mucous membranes and weak peripheral pulses. The lack of expected clinical signs can indicate the time frame of the condition. Splenomegaly, abdominal distention, or heart murmur can be present, depending on the underlying cause of anemia.  Diagnosis of Anemia in Animals Clinical Evaluation A complete history is an important part of evaluating a patient with anemia. Questions covered might include duration of clinical signs, history of exposure to toxins (eg, rodenticides, heavy metals, toxic plants), drug treatments, vaccinations, travel history, and prior illnesses.  Serological Testing A CBC, including platelet and reticulocyte counts, provides information on the severity of anemia and the extent of the bone marrow response, and enables the evaluation of other cell lines.  A blood smear should be evaluated for abnormalities in RBC morphology or size, evidence of agglutination, and RBC parasites. The RBC indices (measures of size and hemoglobin concentration) are calculated by automated cell counters calibrated for the species being examined.  RBC size is expressed by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in femtoliters and can reflect the extent of regeneration.  Macrocytosis (increased MCV) usually correlates with regenerative anemia (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia). Macrocytosis can also be due to defects in DNA synthesis or nuclear maturation, as in cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency or in cats with myelodysplasia caused by feline leukemia virus. In addition, macrocytosis can be a heritable condition in Poodles without anemia.  Microcytosis (decreased MCV) is the hallmark of iron-deficiency anemia and can also be heritable in Akitas.  The hemoglobin concentration of each RBC, measured in grams per deciliter, is defined as the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).  Abnormalities in RBC morphology, such as basophilic stippling, can indicate lead poisoning. The formation of Heinz bodies (see Heinz body images) indicates oxidative injury to the RBCs, secondary to toxin exposure (see the table Toxic Causes of Anemia). Cats are more susceptible to Heinz body formation than are other species; even cats without anemia can have a small number of Heinz bodies.  Heinz bodies, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. Devorah Stowe.  The presence of schistocytes or spherocytes (see spherocyte image) can also help identify the pathophysiological process associated with the cause of anemia (eg, spherocytes are evident in cases of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia).  Spherocytes, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Devorah Stowe.  The reticulocyte count is usually reported as a percentage of the RBC mass. This value should be corrected for the extent of anemia to evaluate the extent of regeneration. An absolute reticulocyte count (measured as RBCs per microliter × reticulocyte percentage) of > 50,000 reticulocytes/mcL in cats or > 60,000 reticulocytes/mcL in dogs is considered regenerative. A corrected reticulocyte percentage > 1% indicates regeneration in dogs and cats (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia). Corrected reticulocyte percentage is calculated as the observed reticulocyte percentage multiplied by the ratio of the patient’s PCV to the normal PCV for that species.  After acute blood loss or hemolytic crisis, reticulocytosis usually takes 3–4 days to become evident.  Plasma or total protein concentration is also useful for further classifying the cause of anemia. The plasma protein concentration is often low with blood loss but normal (or elevated) in cases of hemolysis and decreased production.  A serum chemistry panel and urinalysis can be used to evaluate organ function. If GI blood loss is suspected, an elevation in BUN or decrease in albumin can be noted, or an examination of the feces for blood and parasites can be useful. With hemolytic anemia, total bilirubin can be elevated.  Radiographic examination can help identify occult disease, such as zinc toxicosis due to the presence of a penny in the stomach of a puppy with hemolytic anemia.  Bruising or bleeding can be a sign of a coagulopathy and indicate the need for a coagulation profile. Petechiae or ecchymotic hemorrhage suggests substantial thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathy.  If anemia due to hemolysis is suspected, blood can be evaluated for autoagglutination, or a direct agglutination test (Coombs test) might be indicated (see Anemia Due to Hemolysis).  Serological tests and PCR assays for infectious agents such as feline leukemia virus, Ehrlichia (which causes ehrlichiosis), equine infectious anemia virus, and Babesia (which causes babesiosis) can also help define the cause of anemia (see the table Infectious Causes of Anemia).  Bone marrow evaluation by aspiration or biopsy is indicated in animals with an unexplained, nonregenerative anemia. If the CBC reveals a decrease in more than one cell line, possibly indicating hypoplastic marrow, a biopsy is indicated, along with aspiration.  Biopsy and aspiration are complementary: biopsies are better to evaluate the architecture and extent of cellularity of the marrow; aspiration enables better evaluation of cellular morphology. Aspiration also enables evaluation of the orderly maturation of RBC and WBC lines, the ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursors (M:E ratio), and the number of platelet precursors. Iron stores can also be evaluated by means of Prussian blue staining.  An M:E ratio < 1 indicates that RBC production is greater than WBC production; an M:E ratio > 1 indicates the opposite. The M:E ratio is always interpreted in light of a recent CBC, because changes in the ratio could also be due to suppression of one cell line compared with the other.  Key Points Anemia can be classified on the basis of chronicity, severity, regenerative response, and RBC indices.  Plasma protein concentration should also be used in classifying the underlying cause of anemia.  Clinical signs depend on the severity and duration (acute versus chronic) of the anemia.  Bone marrow evaluation can be necessary for further characterization of nonregenerative anemia.

Anemia Due to Blood Loss in Animals Blood loss anemia is typically regenerative (see blood smear images). Acute blood loss can lead to shock and even death if > 30%–40% of blood is lost and the resulting hypovolemia is not treated aggressively with IV fluid therapy, the administration of compatible blood products, or both.  Regenerative anemia, blood smears, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Causes of acute blood loss can be known (eg, trauma, surgery) or occult (eg, GI blood loss). Coagulopathies, bleeding tumors, gastric ulceration, and external or internal parasites should be excluded as causes. GI parasites, such as Haemonchus in ruminants and hookworms in dogs, can lead to severe blood loss, especially in young animals.  Low-grade, chronic blood loss eventually results in iron-deficiency anemia; however, some reticulocytosis can persist after iron stores have become depleted.  The hallmark of iron-deficiency anemia is microcytic, hypochromic anemia. This chronic blood loss can be due to some type of parasitism in young animals (eg, fleas, lice, intestinal parasitism); in older animals, however, bleeding from GI ulcers or tumors is more common.  Anemia Due to Hemolysis in Animals Hemolytic anemia results from the destruction of RBCs.  Hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative and result from the lysis of RBCs in either the intra- or extravascular space. Intravascular hemolysis results in hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria; extravascular hemolysis does not.  Both types of hemolysis can result in icterus. In dogs, the most common cause of hemolytic anemia is immune mediated (60%–75% of cases). Toxins, RBC trauma, infections, neoplasia, and RBC membrane defects can also cause hemolysis.  Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to neoplasia, infectious agents, inflammatory diseases, drugs, or vaccinations. The ACVIM consensus statement on IMHA diagnosis in dogs and cats recommends a full diagnostic workup that includes infectious disease testing.  In IMHA, the immune system no longer recognizes RBCs as self, and it develops antibodies against circulating RBCs, leading to RBC destruction by macrophages and complement. In some cases, antibodies are directed against RBC precursors in the marrow, resulting in nonregenerative anemia.  Clinical Signs Animals with IMHA usually have icterus, sometimes have fever, and can have splenomegaly.  Diagnosis The following clinical signs and diagnostic test results are hematological hallmarks of IMHA:  regenerative anemia  hyperbilirubinemia  spherocytosis  autoagglutination (see agglutination image)  a positive Coombs test result  Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, agglutination   Image Courtesy of Dr. Robert Jacobs.  A definitive diagnosis of IMHA requires at least two clinical signs of immune-mediated destruction (spherocytosis, autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs test result) and at least one clinical sign of hemolysis (hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinemia, or hemoglobinuria).  When blood is placed in an EDTA tube or onto a microscope slide, autoagglutination can be appreciated as red blood cells sticking together in three-dimensional clumps. To distinguish autoagglutination from overlapping rouleaux formation or other pseudoagglutination, a saline agglutination test (also called slide agglutination test or saline dispersion test) can be performed:  A drop of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) is placed on a microscope slide with a fresh drop of the animal's blood.  The slide should be gently rotated to mix the drops together.  The slide should be evaluated grossly for macroagglutination (see agglutination image). For microagglutination, a 1:4 or 1:10 dilution of blood to saline solution can be evaluated microscopically as a wet mount.  Animals with IMHA that do not demonstrate autoagglutination can still test positive on a direct agglutination test (Coombs test). Confirmatory testing should be performed before treatment for IMHA is initiated.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Confirmatory testing (Coombs test or flow cytometry) is recommended before immunosuppressive therapy is initiated.  A Coombs test detects antibodies or complement on the erythrocyte surface. Results must be interpreted in light of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. If there is clear evidence of IMHA (spherocytosis and true autoagglutination), a Coombs test may not be necessary.  Another technique used to evaluate patients for anti-RBC antibodies is flow cytometry, which enables the detection and quantitation of IgG and IgM bound to the surface of RBCs. Flow cytometry has been found to be 87%–92% specific for diagnosing patients with anti-RBC antibodies. However, it might not be readily available to all veterinary hospitals. The use of flow cytometry has been suggested to assess the response to treatment (1), because there is a decrease in surface anti-RBC antibodies before reticulocytosis or an increase in RBC count.  Treatment Patients with IMHA can show mild clinical signs or be in acute crisis. It is important to tailor treatment to the patient's clinical signs, including treating any underlying infections. Transfusion with packed RBCs is usually required.  The goal of IMHA treatment is to stop the destruction of RBCs by administering immunosuppressive drugs. Supportive care is also a priority.  Prednisone or prednisolone (2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) in dogs, and prednisolone (2–4 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) in cats, is considered first-line treatment of IMHA. Dexamethasone (0.2–0.4 mg/kg, IV, every 24 hours) can be administered on a temporary basis to patients that will not eat or take oral medications.  Adjunctive immunosuppressive drugs are indicated in IMHA patients that have life-threatening disease, depend on transfusions, or are expected to develop severe adverse effects related to the use of glucocorticoids. Such adjunctive agents include the following (2):  mycophenolate (8–12 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours)  cyclosporine (5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours)  azathioprine (2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours, decreased after 2–3 weeks to 2 mg/kg every 48 hours) in dogs (note that azathioprine is contraindicated in cats and can be replaced by chlorambucil, which has been administered with anecdotal success at 0.1–0.2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours)  The veterinary literature is ambiguous on how to select a drug adjunctive to corticosteroids and when to introduce it in the treatment of IMHA. The addition of second-line treatment must be tailored to the individual patient, with consideration of adverse effects.  Pulmonary thromboembolism is a risk in dogs with IMHA. These dogs are often hypercoagulable, which can be documented by thromboelastography.  Dogs documented to be in a hypercoagulable state should be anticoagulated with heparin, which, if the platelet count is > 40,000/mcL, can be administered in combination with an antiplatelet (aspirin at 1–2 mg/kg every 24 hours or clopidogrel at 1–4 mg/kg every 24 hours). The ACVIM consensus statement on IMHA treatment in dogs suggests that clopidogrel be administered in preference to aspirin.  The dosing range for heparin is wide and variable, and it depends on whether the heparin is fractionated or unfractionated. Heparin treatment can be monitored by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or antifactor Xa concentrations (low-molecular-weight heparin).  Thromboprophylaxis should be initiated at the time of diagnosis and continued until the patient is in remission and no longer receiving prednisone or prednisolone.  Mortality rates for IMHA range from 20% to 75%, depending on the severity of clinical signs and the extent of hypercoagulability. Negative prognostic indicators can include the following:  rapid drop in PCV  high bilirubin concentration  moderate to marked leukocytosis (28,000 to > 40,000 cells/mcL)  increased BUN concentration  petechiae  intravascular hemolysis  autoagglutination  disseminated intravascular coagulation  thromboembolic complications  Moderate to marked leukocytosis has been reported as associated with tissue necrosis, most likely secondary to tissue hypoxia or thromboembolic disease. Referral to tertiary care facilities and consideration of extracorporeal treatments (eg, plasmapheresis) can improve the outcome.  Alloimmune Hemolytic Anemia Alloimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by alloantibodies against nonself erythrocyte antigens. Examples include hemolytic transfusion reactions and neonatal isoerythrolysis.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) is an immune-mediated hemolytic disease that occurs in neonatal horses, mules, cattle, pigs, cats, and, rarely, dogs.  NI results when the neonate ingests maternal colostrum containing antibodies against one of the neonate’s blood group antigens. The maternal antibodies develop against specific foreign blood group antigens during previous pregnancies, as a result of unmatched transfusions, and from Babesia and Anaplasma vaccinations in cattle.  Cats are unique in that cats with blood type B have naturally occurring anti-A antibodies without prior exposure, and their kittens with blood type A develop hemolysis after nursing.  In horses, the antigens usually involved are A, C, and Q. NI occurs most commonly in Thoroughbreds and mules.  Neonates with NI are apparently normal at birth; however, they develop severe hemolytic anemia within 2–3 days and become weak and icteric (see icteric mucous membranes image).  Diagnosis is confirmed by screening of maternal serum, plasma, or colostrum and comparison to the paternal or neonatal RBCs.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis, icteric mucous membranes, foal   Image Courtesy of Dr. Thomas Lane.  Treatment of NI consists of stopping any colostrum, supportive care, and blood transfusions. If necessary, neonates can be transfused with triple-washed maternal RBCs.  NI can be avoided by withholding maternal colostrum and giving colostrum from a maternal source free of the antibodies. The newborn’s RBCs can be mixed with maternal serum to look for agglutination before the newborn is allowed to receive maternal colostrum.  Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia results from RBC damage secondary to turbulent flow through abnormal vessels.  In dogs, it can occur secondary to severe heartworm infection, vascular tumors (hemangiosarcoma), splenic torsions, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Causes in other species include hemolytic uremic syndrome in calves, equine infectious anemia, African swine fever, and chronic classical swine fever.  Schistocytes are common in blood smears from animals with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Treatment is to correct the underlying disease process.  Metabolic Causes of Hemolytic Anemia Hypophosphatemia causes postparturient hemolysis and hemoglobinuria in cattle, sheep, and goats. It can occur 2–6 weeks after parturition.  In dogs and cats, hypophosphatemia with secondary hemolysis occurs secondary to diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, and refeeding syndrome. Oral or IV administration of phosphorus is indicated, depending on the extent of hypophosphatemia.  Cattle that drink too much water (water intoxication) are at risk of developing hemolysis secondary to hypotonic plasma. Such cases occur in calves 2–10 months old and lead to respiratory distress and hemoglobinuria. Clinical signs can progress to seizures and coma.  Diagnosis of water intoxication in calves is suggested by hemolytic anemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremia, decreased serum osmolality, and low urine specific gravity. Treatment consists of hypertonic fluids (eg, hypertonic saline solution [2.5% NaCl]) and diuretics (eg, mannitol).  Anemia Due to Toxins, Infections, or Heritable Diseases in Animals Toxins Toxins and drugs can cause anemia via many mechanisms. Those implicated most frequently in animals, along with their pathogenic mechanisms, are listed in the table Toxic Causes of Anemia.  Table Toxic Causes of Anemia Infections Many infectious agents can cause anemia by direct damage to RBCs, leading to hemolysis, or by direct effects on precursors in the bone marrow (see the table Infectious Causes of Anemia).  Table Infectious Causes of Anemia Heritable Diseases Several heritable RBC disorders lead to anemia.  Pyruvate kinase deficiencies occur in Basenjis, Beagles, West Highland White Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and other dog breeds, as well as Abyssinian and Somali cats. There is no treatment for pyruvate kinase deficiency.  Dogs with pyruvate kinase deficiency have a shortened lifespan because of myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis of the bone marrow. Affected cats have chronic intermittent hemolytic anemia, which is sometimes helped by splenectomy and corticosteroids. Cats have not been reported to develop osteosclerosis.  Phosphofructokinase deficiency occurs in English Springer Spaniels. Deficiencies in these enzymes lead to shortened RBC lifespan and regenerative anemia. In dogs with phosphofructokinase deficiency, the hemolytic crises are set off by alkalosis secondary to excessive excitement or exercise. If such situations are minimized, affected dogs can have a normal life expectancy.  A hereditary hemoglobinopathy, porphyria, leads to a buildup of porphyrins in the body and has been described in cattle, cats, and pigs. It is most prevalent in Holstein cattle and can result in a hemolytic crisis. Affected calves fail to thrive and are photosensitive. Diagnosis is based on a finding of increased concentrations of porphyrins in bone marrow, urine, or plasma. Teeth of affected animals fluoresce under ultraviolet light.  Key Points  Hematological hallmarks of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) are hyperbilirubinemia, spherocytosis, autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs test result.  IMHA is commonly treated with supportive care, along with immunosuppression and anticoagulants.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis is an immune-mediated hemolytic disease that results from the ingestion of maternal colostrum containing antibodies against one of the neonate’s blood group antigens.  Other causes of regenerative anemias include hypophosphatemia, drugs, and toxins. Nonregenerative Anemias in Animals ByAllison Kendall, DVM, MS, DACVIM, North Carolina State University Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jul 2024 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Anemia Due to Nutritional Deficiency | Anemia Due to Chronic Disease | Anemia Due to Renal Disease | Anemia Due to Primary Bone Marrow Diseases | Key Points | For More Information Nonregenerative anemias can be due to nutritional deficiencies, chronic disease, renal disease, and primary bone marrow diseases. Acute anemia is initially nonregenerative, until regeneration occurs in 3–4 days; if there's no evidence of regeneration in that time frame, it is classified as nonregenerative.  Anemia Due to Nutritional Deficiency in Animals Nutritional deficiency anemias develop when micronutrients needed for RBC formation are not present in adequate amounts. Anemia develops gradually and can initially be regenerative; ultimately, however, it becomes nonregenerative. Starvation leads to anemia because of a combination of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as well as a negative energy and protein balance.  Deficiencies most likely to cause anemia include the following:  cobalamin (vitamin B12)  copper  iron  niacin  pyridoxine (vitamin B6)  riboflavin  vitamin C (important only in primates and guinea pigs)  vitamin E  Iron deficiency is the most common deficiency in dogs and piglets; it occurs less commonly in horses, cats, and ruminants. Iron deficiency is rarely nutritional in origin; it most commonly occurs secondary to chronic blood loss. Young animals have minimal iron stores, and milk contains very little iron. These factors can be especially important for piglets, which grow rapidly and are often raised indoors with no access to iron. Oral or injectable iron supplementation is indicated as a treatment for iron deficiency, and any source of blood loss must be corrected.  Copper is necessary for the metabolism of iron. Copper deficiency can develop in ruminants fed forage grown in copper-deficient soil, and it can occur secondary to high dietary molybdenum or sulfate in cattle and in pigs fed whey diets. Low blood copper concentrations or low copper concentrations in liver biopsies (more definitive) are diagnostic. Treatment is oral or injectable copper supplementation.  B vitamin deficiencies are rare. Because intestinal malabsorption can contribute to deficiency, measurement of serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate concentrations is recommended for dogs or cats with chronic GI signs.  Certain drugs (eg, anticonvulsants or drugs that interfere with folate metabolism) have been associated with development of folate or cobalamin deficiency, leading to a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia.  Cobalamin malabsorption independent of underlying GI disease has been reported in Giant Schnauzers, Beagles, Border Collies, and Australian Shepherds (their enterocytes are unable to absorb cobalamin). These dogs respond to parenteral supplementation with cobalamin.  Ruminants develop a secondary cobalamin deficiency when grazing on cobalt-deficient pasture. Treatment with oral cobalt or parenteral cobalamin is indicated.  Anemia Due to Chronic Disease in Animals Anemia resulting from chronic disease can be characterized as mild to moderate, nonregenerative, normochromic, and normocytic. It is the most common form of mild anemia in animals. The anemia can be secondary to chronic inflammation or infection, neoplasia, liver disease, hyperadrenocorticism or hypoadrenocorticism, or hypothyroidism.  Anemia due to chronic disease is mediated by cytokines produced by inflammatory cells, which lead to decreases in iron availability, RBC survival, and the marrow’s ability to regenerate. Treatment should be directed at the underlying disease and often results in resolution of the anemia.  Anemia Due to Renal Disease in Animals Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of nonregenerative anemia in animals. Erythropoietin is normally produced by the peritubular endothelial cells in the renal cortex. Animals with renal disease produce less erythropoietin, leading to anemia.  Anemia associated with renal disease should be treated, because it can worsen the renal disease clinical signs and the patient's quality of life and can cause the progression of chronic kidney disease.  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can be used to treat anemia that is due to renal disease. Compared with recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), darbepoetin is hyperglycosylated and, anecdotally, associated with a lower risk of subsequent red cell aplasia. The recommended starting dose is 1 mcg/kg, SC, once weekly in cats, and 0.5–1 mcg/kg, SC, once weekly in dogs. PCV is monitored weekly until the desired improvement is reached (the duration of treatment varies with the initial extent of the anemia), after which the dose interval is increased and PCV continues to be monitored.  Potential adverse effects of darbepoetin include pure red cell aplasia and hypertension; therefore, it is important to monitor PCV and blood pressure. Patients administered darbepoetin or recombinant human erythropoietin require supplemental iron to support RBC production. (Also see Hematinics.)  Molidustat oral suspension has received conditional approval for managing chronic kidney disease–associated anemia in cats. The conditional approval requires that the drug be administered to cats only at 5 mg/kg every 24 hours for 28 days, followed by a required pause of ≥ 7 days. PCV should be monitored during this pause, and when it decreases to < 28%, molidustat oral suspension can be administered for another 28 days followed by the required pause. Vomiting is the most common adverse effect of the drug.   Anemia Due to Primary Bone Marrow Diseases in Animals Primary bone marrow disease or failure from any cause can lead to nonregenerative anemia and pancytopenia. With diffuse marrow involvement, granulocytes are affected first, followed by platelets and finally RBCs.  Aplastic Anemia Aplastic anemia has been reported in dogs, cats, ruminants, horses, and pigs with pancytopenia and a hypoplastic marrow, replaced by fat. Most cases are idiopathic; reported causes include infection (eg, feline leukemia virus disease, ehrlichiosis, parvovirus infection), drug treatment (eg, methimazole, chemotherapeutic agents, antimicrobials [trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol], fenbendazole), toxin ingestion (eg, estrogen), and total body irradiation (see the tables Toxic Causes of Anemia and Infectious Causes of Anemia.  Aplastic anemia can also have an immune-mediated component, which is more common in dogs than in cats.  Diagnosis of aplastic anemia is confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  Treatment consists of eliminating the underlying cause and providing supportive care such as broad-spectrum antimicrobials and transfusions. Immunosuppressive agents such as prednisone or prednisolone, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, or azathioprine can be considered.  Recombinant human erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 mcg/kg, SC, every 24 hours) can be administered until the marrow recovers. If the disease is idiopathic or if marrow recovery is unlikely (eg, as with phenylbutazone toxicosis in dogs), bone marrow transplantation is beneficial if a suitable donor is available.  Pure Red Cell Aplasia In pure red cell aplasia, only the erythroid line is affected. Pure red cell aplasia is characterized by a nonregenerative anemia with severe depletion of RBC precursors in the bone marrow.  Pure red cell aplasia has been reported in dogs and cats and can be primary or secondary. Primary cases are most commonly immune mediated and can respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Supportive care, including transfusion, can be indicated when the anemia is severe.  Cats with feline leukemia virus infection can have pure red cell aplasia. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been reported to cause pure red cell aplasia in dogs and horses. Discontinuation of treatment can eventually lead to RBC recovery in some animals.  Primary Leukemias Primary leukemias are uncommon to rare in domestic species; however, they have been reported in dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, and horses. Retroviruses are a cause in some cattle, cats, primates, and chickens.  Leukemias can develop in myeloid or lymphoid cell lines and are further classified as acute or chronic. Most affected animals have nonregenerative anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, with circulating blast cells usually present.  Acute leukemias, characterized by infiltration of the marrow with blasts, generally respond poorly to chemotherapy. In patients that do respond, remission times are usually short. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs, the response rate to chemotherapy is approximately 30%, with a median survival time of 4 months. Acute myeloblastic leukemias are less common and even less responsive to treatment than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In acute leukemias, the cell lineage is often difficult to identify morphologically, so cytochemical stains or immunological evaluation of cell-surface markers can be necessary for definitive diagnosis.  Chronic leukemias, characterized by an overproduction of one hematopoietic cell line, are less likely to cause anemia and more responsive to treatment.  Myelodysplasia Myelodysplasia (myelodysplastic syndrome, MDS) is considered a preleukemic syndrome characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, resulting in a nonregenerative anemia or other cytopenias. MDS has been described in dogs, cats, and humans.  MDS can be primary or secondary and is common in cats with feline leukemia virus infection. Primary syndromes probably arise from mutations in stem cells. Secondary syndromes result from other neoplasia or drug treatment.  Some cats and dogs respond to treatment of MDS with recombinant human erythropoietin and prednisone. Supportive care with transfusions can be helpful. Survival varies because MDS can progress to leukemia; many affected animals are euthanized or die of sepsis, bleeding, or anemia.  Myelofibrosis Myelofibrosis causes bone marrow failure secondary to replacement of normal marrow elements with fibrous tissue. The disorder has been reported in dogs, cats, humans, and goats.  Myelofibrosis can be a primary disorder or secondary to malignancies, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, whole body irradiation, and congenital anemias (eg, pyruvate kinase deficiency). Diagnosis can be based on bone marrow biopsy.  Treatment of myelofibrosis varies with the underlying cause but usually consists of immunosuppressive therapy.  Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are techniques used to evaluate the bone marrow in domestic animal species. The basic technique is to introduce a hollow needle into the bone to obtain a marrow sample for evaluation. Aspiration provides a sample for cytological evaluation; biopsy provides a sample for histological evaluation. The equipment for these procedures can differ slightly.  The following are indications for bone marrow evaluation:  nonregenerative anemia  thrombocytopenia  leukopenia  bicytopenia  pancytopenia  abnormal circulating cells of any type  monoclonal gammopathy  suspected osteomyelitis  suspected bone neoplasia  infectious disease affecting the bone  clinical staging of neoplastic processes such as lymphoma and mast cell disease  The conventional anatomical sites for bone marrow aspiration include the iliac crest, the trochanteric fossa of the femur, the tibial crest, and the greater tubercle of the humerus. Some clinicians have also used the rib (costochondral junction) or sternebrae. The humerus is the most common site for bone marrow biopsy.  Aspiration Procedure Cats and dogs generally require heavy sedation for bone marrow aspiration; some cats can require general anesthesia. The procedure is as follows:  The patient is placed in one of two positions:  Lateral recumbency for the trochanteric fossa or greater tubercle  Sternal recumbency for the iliac crest  The area to be accessed is shaved and aseptically prepared.  The site, including the periosteum, is infiltrated with local anesthetic.  A scalpel with a No. 11 blade is used to make a stab incision through the skin.  An aspiration needle is inserted into the bone through the incision.  Most bone marrow aspiration needles (eg, Rosenthal, Illinois) are very similar and have a removable stylet. With the stylet in place, the needle is advanced with a back-and-forth screwing motion until the needle is well seated in the bone.  The stylet is removed from the needle, and a 6- to 12-mL syringe is attached for aspiration. This step is the most likely one to cause the patient some discomfort.  A small sample is drawn into the syringe (only enough to fill the hub is required).  The needle is removed.  The sample is put onto slides for cytological evaluation.  Biopsy Procedure Bone marrow biopsy requires general anesthesia. The procedure is similar to that for bone marrow aspiration (see above), except that it requires a Jamshidi needle, which is rigid and hollow with a stylet. The Jamshidi needle has a cutting edge at its end, designed to obtain a core marrow sample (it can also be used to obtain a bone marrow aspirate). Once the needle is well seated in the bone, the cap is unscrewed and the stylet removed.  An aspirate can be obtained as described above. To obtain a core sample for histological evaluation, the needle is advanced further (by approximately 0.6 cm, or a quarter inch) into the marrow while twisting in one direction. The needle is then moved in a wide, circular motion to try to dislodge a core sample.  The needle is removed by twisting in the opposite direction in which it was advanced. A blunt stylet is then passed retrograde to remove the core sample.  The core can be gently rolled onto a slide for cytology and then placed into formalin for histological examination.  Key Points  Nonregenerative anemia may be due to nutritional deficiency, chronic disease, renal disease, or bone marrow disease.  Bone marrow aspiration is a safe procedure that is most commonly indicated for diagnosing peripheral blood abnormalities.  Bone marrow aspiration enables cytological evaluation of cell morphology and cell lines.  Bone marrow biopsy enables histological evaluation of architecture. Blood Groups in Dogs and Cats ByShauna Blois, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM-SAIM, University of Guelph, Ontario Veterinary College Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2024 View the Pet Owner Version Canine Blood Groups | Feline Blood Groups | For More Information A blood type, or blood group, is based on the inherited antigens on an RBC surface:  The major blood group antigens on canine erythrocytes are classified as dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA).  Blood group antigens in cats are classified according to the AB system.  Other blood groups have been recognized outside of the DEA and AB systems.  Exposure to foreign erythrocyte antigens (eg, via blood transfusion) can induce alloantibodies against these antigens in dogs and cats. Cats can have strong naturally occurring alloantibodies (NOAbs) against nonself blood types.    Canine Blood Groups Recognized DEA blood groups include DEA 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. DEA 1 is considered the most clinically relevant blood type in dogs. Historically, DEA 1 was subtyped into DEA 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3; however, quantitative differences in DEA 1 antigenic expression explain these subtypes. DEA 1 is now described as negative, weak positive, and 2+ to 4+ positive. Depending on geographic area, approximately 33–65% of dogs are DEA 1-positive. Anti-DEA 1 antibodies can be induced in DEA 1-negative dogs by transfusion with DEA 1-positive blood, leading to future hemolytic transfusion reactions.   Other identified canine blood groups include Dal, the Japanese D1D2 system, and Kai 1 and 2.  The Dal antigen is present on the surface of most canine erythrocytes, and therefore most dogs are considered Dal-positive. Breeds frequently negative for Dal include Doberman Pinschers, Dalmatians, and Shih Tzu, as well as Lhasa Apsos and Bichons Frises to a lesser extent. Exposure of Dal-negative dogs to Dal-positive erythrocytes leads to sensitization and hemolytic transfusion reactions upon repeated exposure.    Feline Blood Groups The AB blood group is the predominant feline blood grouping system.  Cats are most commonly positive for type A, although prevalence of type B varies geographically and by breed. Rarely, cats are positive for A and B antigens (type AB). The A antigen is inherited as a simple autosomal trait with A being dominant over B. The mode of inheritance for type AB is not known.   The common erythrocyte antigen Mik was previously identified on the erythrocyte surface of most cats. Mik-negative cats can have NOAbs against Mik. In 2021, 5 novel feline erythrocyte antigen (FEA) blood groups were identified (designated FEA 1–5). NOAbs to these antigens can be present in cats that do not express the corresponding antigens.  Typing reagents for Mik are no longer available; however, FEA 1 might correspond to the previously identified Mik antigen.

Crossmatching in Dogs and Cats ByShauna Blois, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM-SAIM, University of Guelph, Ontario Veterinary College Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2024 View the Pet Owner Version Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (0) Videos (0) Crossmatching helps identify immunological (antigen-antibody) incompatibilities between a donor and a recipient:  The major crossmatch test combines the donor's erythrocytes with the recipient's plasma (or serum) to assess for the presence of recipient alloantibodies that will destroy the donor's RBCs.  The minor crossmatch test combines the donor's plasma (or serum) with the recipient's RBCs, assessing for the risk of transfusing alloantibodies from the donor that will destroy the recipient's RBCs.  Crossmatching can be performed in reference laboratories or in clinics manually using a tube or slide method. Point-of-care gel and immunochromatographic commercial crossmatch options are also available and have variable reported agreement with laboratory methods.  Incompatible donor-recipient pairings result in agglutination and entrapment of RBCs within the gel matrix or on the immunochromatographic membrane, signifying a positive (incompatible) reaction (see gel crossmatch test image).  Gel crossmatch test, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Shauna Blois.  Crossmatching is not required before a first transfusion in a dog, due to the lack of naturally occurring alloantibodies (NOAbs), but is strongly recommended > 4 days after a subsequent transfusion.  Due to the presence of highly immunogenic NOAbs in cats, major crossmatching is strongly recommended both before a first transfusion in cats and then > 2 days after any subsequent transfusion.  Screening of Blood Donors and Blood Banking Considerations in Dogs and Cats ByShauna Blois, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM-SAIM, University of Guelph, Ontario Veterinary College Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2024 Blood donors require screening to ensure good health and negative status for geographically relevant infectious diseases that could be transmitted via blood transfusion, including vector-borne diseases in dogs and cats as well as retroviruses in cats. Infectious disease screening guidelines are available for canine and feline blood donors.   Blood is collected aseptically into blood collection bags containing anticoagulant. Blood collected from a blood donor can be left as whole blood or split into packed RBCs, plasma, and platelet components. RBC products are stored at 2–6°C for 21–42 days. Plasma is considered “fresh frozen” when stored at −20°C for up to 1 year and considered “frozen” after 1 year.  When available, component therapy is used to replace only the components of blood required to decrease risk of transfusion reaction and optimize blood resources.  Packed RBCs are used to replace RBCs, especially in cases of hemolysis or lack of RBC production where plasma is not required. Whole blood is best suited for patients with blood loss.   Assessment for transfusion triggers or clinical signs of anemia, rather than reliance on a hematocrit cutoff value, is most helpful for deciding whether an RBC transfusion is needed. Clinical signs of weakness, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, or elevated lactate concentration can indicate the need for RBC transfusion in anemic patients.  Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier solutions (eg, bovine origin) are no longer available as RBC product substitutes. Similar products might be available in the future.  Plasma transfusion is indicated for hemorrhage secondary to coagulopathy and colloid support.  Fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors, von Willebrand factor, albumin, antiproteases, and immunoglobulins; frozen plasma contains most of these components, aside from the labile coagulation factors V and VIII. Cryoprecipitate is a concentrated plasma source of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VIII complex, factor XIII, and fibronectin.  Plasma transfusion is an inefficient method for replacing albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients. Commercially available lyophilized canine albumin is a concentrated albumin product suitable for treatment of hypovolemic shock and hypoalbuminemia. Transfusion of human serum albumin has been reported in dogs previously, although risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions now contraindicates use of this product.  Platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate can be made when whole blood products are processed into components; dimethyl sulfoxide-cryopreserved canine platelet concentrate is commercially available. Lyophilized canine platelets have been reported in the literature as useful for transfusion but are not commercially available.  Whole blood stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours is also a source of platelets, although it is a less concentrated source than platelet products. Platelets are thought to have a relatively short lifespan (up to a few days) after transfusion and are used for uncontrolled or life-threatening hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathia, or as component therapy in massive transfusions.

Only pumps approved for blood products (or gravity flow, without a pump) should be used for delivering blood transfusion.  Transfusion rate depends on patient condition, with rapid rates warranted in individuals with hemodynamic instability and slower delivery (over 4 hours) in more stable patients. Slower transfusion rates are indicated in patients with cardiac disease or renal insufficiency.  Calcium-containing fluids cannot be administered with blood products, and medications should not be administered with the blood transfusion. RBCs remain in the refrigerator until just before use, while frozen plasma products are thawed immediately before use.   Blood product filter, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. Shauna Blois.  All blood donors and recipients should be typed for dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) 1 (dogs) or AB (cats) before transfusion to allow transfusion of type-matched RBC products. While DEA 1-positive dogs can receive DEA 1-negative RBC products without risk of incompatibility, use of DEA 1-positive blood products in DEA 1-positive recipients allows for prudent management of blood bank resources.  Dogs with DEA 1 weak positive blood type warrant special consideration in transfusion, due to the unknown immunological risk of transfusing DEA 1 strongly positive blood to a DEA 1 weak positive dog. A DEA 1 weak positive blood donor is treated as DEA 1-positive, while a DEA 1 weak positive recipient should receive DEA 1-negative blood.   The volume of RBCs transfused can be calculated based on the desired posttransfusion PCV. Patients do not require a normal PCV to achieve hemodynamic stability.  Transfusion volume (in mL) can be calculated as follows:   Packed RBC volume to transfuse = ([desired PCV – recipient's PCV]/unit PCV) × BV × BW  where BV is the recipient's total blood volume (in mL/kg) estimated as 40–60 mL/kg in cats and 80–90 mL/kg in dogs, and BW is body weight (in kg).  For coagulopathies, the recommended dose of plasma to transfuse is 10–20 mL/kg (dogs) or 6–10 mL/kg (cats).  Plasma is not efficient for treatment of hypoproteinemia, but volume of plasma (in mL) can be calculated as the following:  Volume of plasma to transfuse = ([desired TP – recipient's TP]/unit TP) × BV × BW  where TP is total protein, BV is the recipient's total blood volume (in mL/kg) estimated as 40–60 mL/kg in cats and 80–90 mL/kg in dogs, and BW is body weight (in kg).  Canine lyophilized albumin is reconstituted to various concentrations just before use depending on need. A 5% solution is recommended for normovolemic dogs. Dosing to achieve a patient albumin level of 2–2.5 g/dL is recommended; 450 mg/kg is needed to raise serum albumin by 0.5 g/dL.   Platelet-rich plasma, platelet concentrate, and cryopreserved platelet transfusions are dosed at 1 unit per 10 kg of recipient's body weight and administered within 2 hours.   If patient condition permits, many clinics use a test dose before administering an RBC transfusion, giving a small amount of blood (eg, 0.25 mL/kg for 15 minutes) and closely monitoring for clinical signs of a transfusion reaction. If no concerns are noted, the transfusion proceeds at the indicated rate.   Risks of Blood Transfusion in Dogs and Cats Transfusion recipients should be closely monitored throughout and after the transfusion. Vital signs should be assessed every 15 minutes during the first hour, hourly until cessation of the transfusion, then at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours after the transfusion is finished. Patients should be assessed immediately if any clinical signs of a reaction are suspected. PCV can be assessed when RBC transfusion is completed to evaluate transfusion efficacy.    Fever Fever is one of the most common clinical signs of a transfusion reaction. A febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is defined as a body temperature > 39°C (102.2°F) and an increase in temperature of > 1°C (1.8°F), during or within 4 hours of a transfusion, with no other identified causes. An FNHTR is a mild and self-limiting reaction secondary to transfusion of leukocyte and platelet antigens, as well as proinflammatory mediators, and does not require treatment. More severe transfusion reactions can also present with fever; therefore, fever should prompt complete patient assessment.  Use of leukoreduced blood products has been associated with decreased rates of FNHTR in dogs.    Hemolysis Hemolysis can be due to nonimmunological causes (eg, damage to RBCs transfused from improper storage or administration techniques) or to immunological causes from type II hypersensitivity (antigen-antibody) reactions. The most common example of an immunological acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) is transfusion of a blood type against which the recipient has antibodies.  Clinical signs of AHTR can range in severity from fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea to hypotension, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. AHTRs are characterized by an inadequate increase in PCV after transfusion and clinical signs of hemolysis (eg, new hyperbilirubinemia or hemoglobinemia, presence of spherocytes, presence of ghost cells). Fever might be present.  In the case of an AHTR, the transfusion must be stopped and fluid resuscitation and other supportive care initiated as needed. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions can occur secondary to immunological incompatibilities and are often not clinically detectable other than by an accelerated decline in PCV > 24 hours after RBC transfusion.   Respiratory Distress Respiratory distress transfusion reactions are most commonly due to transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).  Clinical signs of TACO include new onset of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, cough) during or within 24 hours after the transfusion. Radiographic signs of enlarged pulmonary venous vasculature or pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates, cardiac ultrasonogram showing enlarged left atrial to aortic ratio, or new increases in BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) concentration support a diagnosis of TACO.  TACO is treated by stopping the transfusion, judicious use of diuretics, and supportive care.  Transfusion-related acute lung injury is not commonly reported in veterinary patients.    Acute Allergic Reactions Acute allergic reactions cause a range of clinical signs during or within a few hours of a transfusion. Canine allergic reactions typically involve the skin and GI tract, with urticaria, edema, and vomiting commonly reported. Feline allergic reactions are primarily respiratory in nature and can cause dyspnea, although skin and GI signs can also occur. More severe allergic and anaphylactic reactions can cause hypotension and shock. Antihistamines are used to treat mild allergic reactions.  For clinical signs of anaphylaxis, epinephrine and other supportive care, as indicated, are administered.   Infection Transfusion-transmitted infection reactions arise after transfusion of pathogen-contaminated blood products. Clinical signs depend on the pathogen transmitted. Bacterial contamination of blood products can lead to a range of clinical signs, including vomiting, fever, and shock. Samples of the transfused product and of the recipient's blood should be cultured to investigate suspected bacterial contamination.  Xenotransfusion Transfusion of canine blood to a feline recipient (xenotransfusion) has been occasionally reported as an option for transfusing cats, especially when type B blood is not available for a type B recipient. Transfused canine RBCs have a short half-life in feline recipients, and there is risk of AHTR. Crossmatching is recommended before xenotransfusion to identify the most suitable transfusion product. Xenotransfusion is only indicated if all other compatible species-specific transfusion options are exhausted and warrants close consultation with clients regarding associated risks.  Neonatal Isoerythrolysis Type B queens have high titer, naturally occurring alloantibodies against type A erythrocytes, and their colostrum contains a high concentration of these anti-A antibodies. Type A or AB offspring born to a type B queen acquire anti-A antibodies in colostrum. In a neonate during the first 24 hours after birth, intestinal permeability is increased, and antibodies are absorbed systemically, leading to hemolysis. Consequently, during this period, type A and AB kittens should receive alternative feeding. Because intestinal permeability decreases within 24 hours of birth, kittens can return to nurse from the queen 24 hours after birth. Genotyping can identify B/B breeding pairs to prevent neonatal isoerythrolysis.   Key Points Blood typing for DEA 1 is strongly recommended before transfusion in dogs; AB blood typing is essential before transfusion in cats.   Cats can have naturally occurring alloantibodies against other blood types; both cats and dogs can acquire antibodies against nonself blood types through transfusion exposure.   Major crossmatching is recommended in dogs > 4 days after any transfusion and in cats, regardless of previous transfusion history, > 2 days after prior transfusion to decrease risk of immunological incompatibility between blood donors and recipients.

Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 Anaplasmosis is a tickborne disease of ruminants caused by intracellular bacteria that infect red blood cells, causing fever and anemia. Diagnosis relies upon Giemsa-stained blood smears and serologic tests such as ELISA. Key treatments include tetracyclines and imidocarb; in some countries, less pathogenic species are used as live vaccines for the control of bovine anaplasmosis. Etiology and Pathogenesis | Transmission and Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment, Control, and Prevention | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (0) Videos (0)  Anaplasmosis traditionally refers to a disease of ruminants caused by obligate intraerythrocytic bacteria of the order Rickettsiales, family Anaplasmataceae, genus Anaplasma. Cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and some wild ruminants can be infected with the erythrocytic Anaplasma. Anaplasmosis occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (~40°N to 32°S), including South and Central America, the USA, southern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.  The Anaplasma genus also includes A phagocytophilum (compiled from species previously known as Ehrlichia phagocytophila, E equi, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent, A bovis (formerly E bovis), and A platys (formerly E platys), all of which invade blood cells other than erythrocytes of their respective mammalian hosts. Bovine anaplasmosis is of economic significance in the cattle industry. A phagocytophilum is the causative agent of equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis.  Etiology and Pathogenesis of Anaplasmosis Clinical bovine anaplasmosis is usually caused by A marginale. A centrale was isolated in South Africa from cattle with a mild disease and is often used as a vaccine to protect from A marginale infections. A ovis may cause mild to severe disease in sheep, deer, and goats and is less common than A marginale infection. A phagocytophilum has recently been reported to infect cattle; however, natural infection is rare and it does not cause clinical disease.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Anaplasmosis in Ruminants Up to 17 different tick vector species (including Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes, Hyalomma, and Argas) have been reported to transmit Anaplasma spp (except A centrale found naturally in South Africa from R simus ticks only). Not all of these are likely significant vectors in the field, and it has been shown that strains of A marginale also coevolve with particular tick strains. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp are major vectors of A marginale in Australia and Africa, and Dermacentor spp are the main vectors in the USA. Mechanical transmission via biting dipterans occurs in some regions. Anaplasmosis may also be spread through the use of contaminated needles or dehorning or other surgical instruments.  There is a strong correlation between age of cattle and severity of disease. Calves are much more resistant to disease (although not infection) than older cattle. This resistance is not due to colostral antibody from immune dams. In endemic areas where cattle first become infected with A marginale early in life, losses due to anaplasmosis are minimal. After recovery from the acute phase of infection, cattle remain chronically infected carriers but are generally immune to further clinical disease. However, these chronically infected cattle may relapse to anaplasmosis when immunosuppressed (eg, by corticosteroids), when infected with other pathogens, or after splenectomy. Carriers serve as a reservoir for further transmission. Serious losses occur when mature cattle with no previous exposure are moved into endemic areas or under endemically unstable situations when transmission rates are insufficient to ensure that all cattle are infected before reaching the more susceptible adult age.  Clinical Findings of Anaplasmosis In animals < 1 year old, anaplasmosis is usually subclinical, in yearlings and 2-year-olds it is moderately severe, and in older cattle it is severe and often fatal. Anaplasmosis is characterized by progressive anemia due to extravascular destruction of infected and uninfected erythrocytes. The prepatent period of A marginale is directly related to the infective dose and typically ranges from 15–36 days (although it may be as long as 100 days). After the prepatent period, peracute (most severe but rare), acute, or chronic anaplasmosis may follow. Rickettsemia approximately doubles every 24 hours during the exponential growth phase. Generally, 10%–30% of erythrocytes are infected at peak rickettsemia, although this figure may be as high as 65%. RBC count, PCV, and hemoglobin values are all severely reduced. Macrocytic anemia with circulating reticulocytes may be present late in the disease.  Animals with peracute infections succumb within a few hours of the onset of clinical signs. Acutely infected animals lose condition rapidly. Milk production falls. Inappetence, loss of coordination, breathlessness when exerted, and a rapid, bounding pulse are usually evident in the late stages. The urine may be brown, but, in contrast to babesiosis, hemoglobinuria does not occur. A transient febrile response, with the body temperature rarely exceeding 106°F (41°C) occurs at about the time of peak rickettsemia. Mucous membranes appear pale and then yellow. Pregnant cows may abort. Surviving cattle convalesce over several weeks, during which hematologic parameters gradually return to normal.  Bos indicus breeds of cattle appear to possess a greater resistance to A marginale infection than B taurus breeds, but variation of resistance of individuals within breeds of both species occurs. Differences in virulence between Anaplasma strains and the level and duration of the rickettsemia also play a role in severity of clinical manifestations.  Lesions Lesions are typical of those found in animals with anemia due to erythrophagocytosis. The carcasses of cattle that die from anaplasmosis are generally markedly anemic and jaundiced. Blood is thin and watery. The spleen is characteristically enlarged and soft, with prominent follicles. The liver may be mottled and yellow-orange. The gallbladder is often distended and contains thick brown or green bile. Hepatic and mediastinal lymph nodes appear brown. There are serous effusions in body cavities, pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhages in the epi- and endocardium, and often evidence of severe GI stasis. Widespread phagocytosis of erythrocytes is evident on microscopic examination of the reticuloendothelial organs. A significant proportion of erythrocytes are usually found to be parasitized after death due to acute infection.  Diagnosis of Anaplasmosis Diagnosis based on clinical signs, blood smears, and serologic testing  Anaplasma marginale, bovine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Ms. Sue Anderson, Tick Fever Centre, Wacol, Queensland, Australia.  A marginale, together with the hemoprotozoa Babesia bovis and B bigemina, are the causative agents of tick fever in cattle. These three species have similar geographic distributions, except that anaplasmosis occurs in the absence of babesiosis in the USA. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films is critical to distinguish anaplasmosis from babesiosis and other conditions that result in anemia and jaundice, such as leptospirosis and theileriosis. Blood in anticoagulant should also be obtained for hematologic testing. In Giemsa-stained thin blood films, Anaplasma spp appear as dense, homogeneously staining blue-purple inclusions 0.3–1 mcm in diameter. A marginale inclusions are usually located toward the margin of the infected erythrocyte, whereas A centrale inclusion bodies are located more centrally.  Inclusion bodies contain 1–8 initial bodies 0.3–0.4 mcm in diameter, which are the individual rickettsiae. The percentage of infected erythrocytes varies with the stage and severity of disease; maximum rickettsemias in excess of 50% can occur with A marginale. Microscopically, the infection becomes visible 2–6 weeks after transmission. During the course of infection, the rickettsemia can double each day for up to 10 days and then decreases. Severe anemia can persist for weeks after parasites cannot be detected in blood smears.  Chronically infected carriers may be identified with a fair degree of accuracy by serologic testing using the msp5 ELISA, complement fixation, or card agglutination tests. Nucleic acid-based detection methods are not always useful because these tests may not detect carrier levels.  At necropsy, thin blood films of liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and peripheral blood should be prepared for microscopic examination.  Treatment, Control, and Prevention of Anaplasmosis Tetracyclines, imidocarb, and vaccination by inoculation with less pathogenic species  Tetracycline antibiotics and imidocarb are currently used for treatment. Infections may be completely cleared by treatment with these drugs and the cattle then remain immune to severe anaplasmosis for at least 8 months.  Prompt administration of tetracycline drugs (tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, rolitetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) in the early stages of acute disease (eg, PCV >15%) usually ensures survival. A commonly used treatment consists of a single IM injection of long-acting oxytetracycline at a dosage of 20 mg/kg. Blood transfusion to partially restore the PCV greatly improves the survival rate of more severely affected cattle. The carrier state may be eliminated by administration of a long-acting oxytetracycline preparation (20 mg/kg, IM, at least two injections with a 1-week interval). Withholding periods for tetracyclines apply in most countries. Injection into the neck muscle rather than the rump is preferred.  Imidocarb is also highly efficacious against A marginale as a single injection (as the dihydrochloride salt at 1.5 mg/kg, SC, or as imidocarb dipropionate at 3 mg/kg, SC). Elimination of the carrier state requires the use of higher repeated doses of imidocarb (eg, 5 mg/kg, IM or SC, two injections of the dihydrochloride salt 2 weeks apart). Imidocarb is a suspected carcinogen with long withholding periods and is not approved for use in the USA or Europe.  In South Africa, Australia, Israel, and South America, infection with live A centrale (originating from South Africa) has been used as a vaccine to provide cattle with partial protection against the disease caused by A marginale. In the USA, where live vaccines cannot be used, vaccines comprising nonliving A marginale purified from infected bovine erythrocytes and adjuvant have been used in the past but are no longer available. Long-lasting immunity against A marginale is conferred by preimmunization with live rickettsia, combined with the use of chemotherapy to control severe reactions. .Subunit vaccines to control bovine anaplasmosis are under investigation. In some areas, sustained stringent control or elimination of the arthropod vectors may be a viable control strategy; however, in other areas immunization is recommended.  Key Points Bovine anaplasmosis is endemic in many areas of the world and is transmitted by several tick vectors.  Certain countries use the less pathogenic Anaplasma centrale as a live vaccine, but it has not been used in North America.  Clinical signs include progressive anemia and fever with disease severity age-dependent, because cattle < 1 year old show no or mild clinical signs. Laboratory diagnosis is usually confirmed using stained blood smears and ELISA.  Outbreaks of bovine anaplasmosis are usually seasonal, and tetracyclines and imidocarb are effective treatments.  A ovis causes mild to severe disease in sheep, goats, and deer but is not infectious for cattle. Dogs and Cats Babesia spp have been reported in dogs from most geographic areas. These include B canis, B vogeli, and B rossi. Babesia canis is transmitted by Dermacentor reticularis in Europe, B vogeli by Rhipicephalus sanguineus in tropical and subtropical countries, and B rossi by Haemaphysalis elliptica in South Africa. Consequences of Babesia infection vary from a mild, transient illness to acute disease that rapidly results in death.  Babesia gibsoni is the other important Babesia of dogs and is a much smaller parasite. It has a more limited distribution and characteristically causes a chronic disease with progressive, severe anemia that is not readily treated with normal babesiacides.  Illness of varying severity due to B felis in domestic cats has mostly been reported in southern Africa, as well as B leo, and B lengau and less-well defined species. Sporadic cases associated with other Babesia species have been reported elsewhere. An unusual feature of B felis is its lack of response to the normal babesiacides.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Babesiosis in Animals The major economic impact of babesiosis is to the cattle industry in tropical and subtropical geographic areas, and is attributed to Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina; however, the diseases caused by different Babesia have many common features. Babesiosis is a tickborne disease and its geographic distribution is therefore determined by the distribution of tick vectors. The main vectors of B bigemina and B bovis are 1-host Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp ticks which are widespread in tropical and subtropical areas. Transmission occurs transovarially. Although these Babesia spp can be readily transmitted experimentally by blood inoculation, mechanical transmission by insects or during surgical procedures has no practical importance. Intrauterine infection has also been reported but is rare.  In Rhipicephalus spp ticks, the blood stages of the parasite are ingested during engorgement and undergo sexual and asexual multiplication in the replete female, infecting eggs and subsequent parasitic stages. Transmission to the host occurs when larvae (in the case of B bovis) or nymphs and adults (in the case of B bigemina) feed. The percentage of larvae infected can vary from 0%–50% or higher, depending mainly on the level of parasitemia of the host at the time the female ticks engorge. Under field conditions, the rate of tick transmission is generally higher for B bigemina than for B bovis.  In endemic areas, three features are important in determining the risk of clinical disease in cattle:  Calves have a level of immunity (related both to colostral-derived antibodies and to age-specific factors) that persists for ~6–8 months, whereas older animals without immunity are susceptible to clinical disease.  Animals that recover from Babesia infections are generally immune for the typical productive lifespan of animals raised in commercial settings.  The susceptibility of cattle breeds to ticks and Babesia infections varies (eg, Bos indicus cattle tend to be more resistant to both ticks and the effects of B bovis and B bigemina infection than Bos taurus–derived breeds).  At high levels of tick transmission, virtually all calves become infected with Babesia by 6–8 months of age, show few if any clinical signs, become immune, and retain this immunity into their adult life. This situation can be altered by a reduction in tick numbers, either natural (eg, climatic) or artificial (eg, acaricide treatment or changing breed composition of herd). Low tick numbers may mean that there is insufficient transmission of Babesia to calves to ensure all are infected. Other circumstances that can lead to clinical outbreaks include the introduction of susceptible cattle to endemic areas and the incursion of Babesia-infected ticks into previously tick-free areas.  Major epizootics occurred in cattle in the US, Australia, and South Africa in the 19th century, associated with the movement of infected cattle and the tick vector. Some countries retain tick-free quarantine zones as a means of controlling the spread of the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) tick vector.  Bovine babesiosis is an OIE-listed disease and included on the Voluntary 2021 U.S. National Animal Health Reporting System (NAHRS) Reportable Diseases, Infections, and Infestations List.  Zoonotic Risk Cases of babesiosis in humans have been reported. The rodent parasite B microti and the cattle parasite B divergens are the most commonly implicated species in North America and Europe, respectively. However, B duncani, B venatorum, and some less well-defined species have also been implicated. The reservoir hosts and vectors of some of these species are not necessarily known. Babesiosis infections in humans are acquired via bites from infected ticks or via contaminated blood from an infected transfusion donor. Cases reported in splenectomized or otherwise immunocompromised individuals are often fatal.  Clinical Findings of Babesiosis in Animals Acute babesiosis generally runs a course of ~1 week or less. The first clinical signs are lethargy, weakness, depression, and fever (frequently ≥106°F [41°C]), which persist throughout, and these are accompanied later by inappetence, anemia, jaundice, and weight loss; hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria occur in the final stages. Involvement of the CNS due to adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes in brain capillaries can occur with B bovis infections. Late-term pregnant cows may abort, and temporary infertility due to transient fever may occur in bulls. Many animals recover; however, some may die if not treated.  Animals that recover from the acute disease remain infected for a number of years with B bovis or for a few months with B bigemina. No clinical signs are apparent during this carrier state.  Postmortem Lesions Postmortem lesions (particularly with B bovis) include the following:  enlarged and friable spleen  swollen liver with an enlarged gallbladder containing thick granular bile  congested, dark-colored kidneys  generalized anemia and jaundice  Most clinical cases of B bigemina have hemoglobinuria; however, this is not invariably the case with B bovis. Other organs, including the brain and heart, may show congestion or petechiae.

Examination of Giemsa-stained blood or organ smears by light microscopy is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Light microscopy is rapid and inexpensive but does require some expertise. From the live animal, blood smears should be prepared from capillaries, for example from the ear or tail tip, to improve the sensitivity of detection of B bovis, because B bovis-infected erythrocytes adhere to capillary endothelium. Smears of brain, muscle, kidney, spleen, and from a blood vessel in an extremity should be taken at postmortem examination. Note that detection of Babesia spp using light microscopy in the carrier state has poor sensitivity.  Microscopically, the species of Babesia involved can be determined morphologically; however, expertise is required, especially in B bovis infections in which few organisms may be present. Babesia bovis is generally small, with the parasites in paired form at an obtuse angle to each other and measuring ~1–1.5 × 0.5–1 mcm. B bigemina is larger (3–3.5 × 1–1.5 mcm), with paired parasites lying almost parallel or at an acute angle to each other. Single forms of both parasites are also commonly seen.  Other Diagnostic Tests Molecular methods such as PCR assays are more sensitive than light microscopy and may be useful to detect Babesia spp in the carrier state or during chronic infection. Molecular methods are also used to differentiate and characterize isolates. Because of the persistence of the organisms in the blood, detection of the organisms does not necessarily indicate that they are the cause of the current disease or are having any health impact.  Serologic tests have been described for the detection of antibodies to Babesia spp in carrier animals. The most commonly used are the indirect fluorescent antibody test and ELISA. These are not useful for diagnosis in the acute stage of illness.  Subinoculation of blood (~500 mL) into a fully susceptible animal, preferably a splenectomized calf, and subsequent monitoring of the recipient for infection may occasionally be justified to confirm infection in suspected carrier animals.  Treatment, Control, and Prevention of Babesiosis in Animals Babesiacides  Supportive treatment  Tick control  Use of resistant breeds  Vaccination  Babesiacides A variety of babesiacidal drugs have been used to treat bovine babesiosis; however, only diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate are still in common use. These drugs are not available in all endemic countries, or their use may be restricted. Manufacturers' recommendations for use should be followed. For treating cattle, diminazene is administered at 3.5 mg/kg, IM, once. For treatment, imidocarb is administered at 1.2 mg/kg, SC, once. At a dosage of 3 mg/kg, imidocarb provides protection from babesiosis for approximately 4 weeks and may also eliminate B bovis and B bigemina from carrier animals.  Supportive Treatment Supportive treatment is advisable, particularly in valuable animals, and may include the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and fluid therapy. Blood transfusions may be lifesaving in very anemic animals.  Tick Control Tick control, via acaricides or management practices, can be useful in reducing tick burdens, which can lower transmission rates. However, this can lead to naive cattle populations, with consequent risk of outbreaks of disease should tick populations increase. Chemical tick control cannot be relied upon to prevent transmission of Babesia, and outbreaks often occur after introduction of susceptible cattle to endemic areas despite acaricide use. Acaricide resistance is also an increasing problem. However, acaricidal tick control before moving animals from tick-infested areas is useful to prevent the introduction of ticks and babesiosis to tick-free areas.  Eradication of the tick vector is rarely feasible on individual premises but may work on a regional level in well-coordinated programs.  Using Resistant Breeds Bos indicus–based breeds are commonly used to minimize production losses associated with ticks and babesiosis.  Vaccination Vaccination using live attenuated strains of the Babesia parasites has been used successfully in countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, and Uruguay. The vaccine is available in either a chilled or frozen form. One vaccination produces adequate immunity for the typical productive lifespan of animals raised in commercial settings. Commercial vaccines based on recombinant antigens are not yet available.  Key Points Hemotropic Mycoplasma Infections in Animals (Hemoplasmas) ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Hemoplasmas are bacteria in the genus Mycoplasma that lack cell walls and attach to erythrocytes of target hosts, potentially causing host immune-based anemia. Many infections are asymptomatic. Diagnosis can be based on microscopy or PCR. Antibiotics and supportive care are the usual treatments. Transmission | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Zoonotic Risk | Feline Infectious Anemia | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (4) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Hemoplasmas, or hemotropic mycoplasmas, are epierythrocytic parasites within the order Mycoplasmatales. Modern taxonomy provisionally accepts that the genus Mycoplasma now contains genera previously known as Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon based on hemoplasmas' lack of a cell wall, use of the codon UGA to encode tryptophan, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Those species for which full characterization based on bacterial culture is lacking are given the designation \"Candidatus.\"  Hemoplasmas infect a wide variety of vertebrates throughout the world, including several reported to infect human beings. They have morphologic features such as rod, coccoid, and ring-shaped structures found individually or in chains on the red cell, and they stain gram-negative because of the lack of a cell wall. None of the hemoplasmas have been cultured in vitro. Hemoplasmas attach to the surface of the host's red cells and may, under certain conditions, penetrate the cell.  Several hemoplasmas are of veterinary importance ( see Table: Hemoplasmas of Veterinary Importance). In addition to varying host tropism, these organisms vary in their ability to cause clinically significant hemolytic anemia.  Table Hemoplasmas of Veterinary Importance Transmission of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Hemoplasmas may be transmitted by transfer of infected blood (blood transfusion or use of contaminated needles, surgical instruments, or herd or flock management equipment) or via arthropod vectors such as lice, flies, ticks, and mosquitoes. Vertical transmission from mother to offspring has been reported in cats, swine, and camelids. Direct transmission, possibly associated with fighting, is suspected in cats and supported by studies reporting presence of hemoplasma DNA in saliva, on gingiva, and on claw beds of infected cats.  Clinical Findings of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Hemoplasmas can cause hemolytic anemia, but the severity varies greatly. Most animals develop asymptomatic infections, with more severe, acute anemias associated with certain hemoplasma strains, splenectomy, immunocompromise, concurrent infection (such as with feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus in cats), or coinfection with multiple hemoplasma species. Notably, M haemofelis causes acute, potentially severe or fatal hemolytic anemia in healthy cats. Typical clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and fever, with splenomegaly and icterus occurring less often.  M haemocanis causes acute hemolysis in dogs that are splenectomized, but infections are usually asymptomatic in healthy dogs.  M suis causes hemolytic anemia accompanied by icterus in neonatal pigs, feeder pigs, and pregnant sows. Chronic infection is associated with poor growth rates, decreased conception rates, reproductive failure, and decreased milk production.  M wenyonii infection in cattle is usually asymptomatic, but a syndrome of mammary gland and hindlimb edema, decreased milk production, fever, and lymphadenopathy has been described in young, nonanemic, primiparous heifers. Infection in young bulls has been reported to cause scrotal and hindlimb edema.  M ovis infection in sheep and goats is often asymptomatic, but hemolytic anemia can occur in young animals, especially those with heavy intestinal worm burdens. Chronic infection may result in poor weight gain, exercise intolerance, decreased wool production, and mild anemia.  Hemoplasma infection in camelids can cause a severe hemolytic anemia in young crias.  The prevalence of chronic infection in sheep, pigs, and kennel-raised dogs is high, and outbreaks of acute disease have been reported in animals during research studies. Presence of hemoplasma infection may affect experimental results and lead to misinterpretation of data.  The hemolysis caused by hemoplasma infections is immune-mediated and typically extravascular, resulting in a regenerative anemia. Erythrocyte agglutination may be present, and Coombs’ test results are often positive in cats infected with M haemofelis. Splenectomized dogs with acute hemolysis due to M haemocanis may have agglutination, spherocytosis, and a positive Coombs’ test. Hypoglycemia secondary to glucose consumption by the bacteria has been reported in heavily parasitized pigs, sheep, llamas, and calves; however, rapid bacterial glycolysis in vitro may also cause artifactually decreased blood glucose concentrations.  Diagnosis of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Microscopy or PCR  Historically, diagnosis of hemoplasmas has been made based on detection of organisms on routine Wright-stained blood smears, on which they appear as small (0.5–3 mcm), basophilic, round, rod, or ring-shaped structures present on erythrocytes individually or in chains, or sometimes seen free in the background. However, sensitivity of the blood smear may be poor, because parasitemia in chronic infections can be cyclic, and organisms can disappear from circulation in as little as 2 hours. Hemoplasmas dissociate from erythrocytes and die after a variable amount of time in EDTA, hampering detection of organisms in aged samples. Specificity of the test is also poor if there are few organisms and if characteristic morphology isn't present to differentiate from stain artifact or other nonpathogenic structures.

Mycoplasma (Eperythrozoon) suis, porcine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. Bruce Lawhorn.  PCR assays capable of discriminating among hemoplasmas have greatly enhanced diagnosis of these parasites and has led to identification of several new Mycoplasma species. PCR can be run on whole blood and aspirates of the spleen.  Treatment and Control of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Antimicrobial and supportive treatment  For acute hemoplasma infections, tetracyclines (doxycycline, oxytetracycline) are the mainstay of treatment; pradofloxacin and marbofloxacin have also been effective against M haemofelis. Glucocorticoids may be useful to decrease erythrophagocytosis in cases of severe hemolysis because the primary mechanism of damage is immune-mediated targeting of infected host cells. Some animals may require blood transfusion, but animals must be carefully monitored because the parasite can rapidly infect transfused cells as well. Treated animals may remain carriers and may experience periodic clinical relapses with reemerging parasitemia if the animal is stressed or immunocompromised.  Once an initial infection is controlled, either naturally or after antibiotic treatment, protective immunity develops against repeat M haemofelis infection; how long this immunity will last and whether this applies to other hemoplasma infections is unknown.  Blood donors should be screened using PCR-based DNA assays to prevent transmission to transfusion recipients. Iatrogenic transmission can be avoided by using properly sterilized needles and equipment. Control of arthropod vectors is recommended, as is minimizing stress in managing herds and flocks.  Zoonotic Risk of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas Hemoplasma infections are typically species specific, except for M ovis, which infects both sheep and goats, and \"Candidatus M haemolamae,\" which infects both llamas and alpacas. There are reports of human eperythrozoonosis from Inner Mongolia, China, but supporting evidence is not compelling. There have also been rare reports of hemoplasma infections in immunocompromised people in which molecular methods were used for confirmation. One report documented an HIV-positive human patient coinfected with Bartonella henselae and a hemoplasma genetically similar to M haemofelis. This individual owned five cats and had multiple scratch and bite wounds. All five cats were PCR positive for Bartonella spp and two were positive for M haemofelis, suggesting the possibility of zoonotic transmission. The coinfection of a veterinarian in Texas with B henselae and M ovis also has been reported.  Feline Infectious Anemia (Hemoplasmosis) In cats, hemotropic mycoplasmosis can produce a disease called feline infectious anemia (FIA), previously known as hemobartonellosis. M haemofelis (previously the Ohio strain, or large form, of Haemobartonella felis) is the most pathogenic organism causing FIA, and it can cause hemolytic anemia in immunocompetent cats. \"Candidatus M haemominutum\" (previously the California strain, or small form, of H felis) is the most common hemoplasma in cat populations worldwide, but it has not been clearly associated with disease in immunocompetent cats. \"Candidatus M turicensis\" has never been seen on blood smears, and its pathogenicity is not well understood. Both Candidatus species may be capable of inducing anemia in cats with underlying immunosuppressive disease, such as feline leukemia virus infection.  In the case of M haemofelis infection, an incubation period of 2–30 days is followed by anemia, with some cats developing cyclical changes in PCV that coincide with the appearance of large numbers of organisms on blood smears. In untreated cats, this acute phase lasts for 3–4 weeks, after which some cats may remain chronically infected despite normal or near normal PCV values. It has been suggested that recrudescence of anemia may occur when these chronically infected cats are subject to debilitating disease, stress, or immunosuppressive therapies.  Any anemic cat, especially one with an anemia showing evidence of regeneration (polychromasia and/or reticulocytosis), may be suspected of having FIA. The severity of clinical signs correlates with the rapidity of onset of anemia. Clinical findings include weakness, pallor of the mucous membranes, tachypnea, tachycardia, and occasionally collapse. Acutely ill cats may be febrile, and moribund cats may be hypothermic. Other physical examination abnormalities may include cardiac murmurs, splenomegaly, and icterus. In chronic or slowly developing cases, there may be normal or subnormal body temperature, weakness, depression, and weight loss or emaciation.  Expected laboratory abnormalities include a moderate to marked regenerative anemia, increased numbers of nucleated RBCs, polychromasia, anisocytosis, Howell-Jolly bodies, and an increased reticulocyte count. Coombs’ tests can become positive 7–14 days after organisms appear in the blood and remain positive throughout the acute phase, reverting to negative in chronically infected carrier cats.  Haemobartonella felis, feline blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Laboratory confirmation has traditionally been based on identification of organisms in the peripheral blood using light microscopy, although M haemofelis is visible < 50% of the time in acutely infected cats. PCR assays are available in many laboratories and are considerably more sensitive and specific than blood-smear evaluation.  Without treatment, one third of acutely ill cats may die. Treatment involves supportive therapies, such as oxygen and blood transfusions, as well as specific therapy with doxycycline (10 mg/kg/day, PO, for a minimum of 2 weeks). Because of the potential for esophagitis and esophageal strictures, administration of doxycycline hyclate preparations should be followed by administration of a bolus of several milliliters of water. Either marbofloxacin or pradofloxacin is a suitable alternative to doxycycline. Treatment of PCR-positive, healthy cats is currently not recommended, because no regimen has yet been identified that completely eliminates the organism. Immunosuppressive dosages of glucocorticoids to suppress immune-mediated RBC injury may be used in cats that do not respond to antimicrobial therapy alone, or when primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a possible cause.  Key Points Hemoplasmas are bacteria in the genus Mycoplasma that infect RBCs of several species of animals.  Infection is often asymptomatic but can be diagnosed by microscopy or PCR.  Treatments include antibiotics and supportive care. Old World Hepatozoonosis and American Canine Hepatozoonosis ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Disease associated with Hepatozoon canis infection, or Old World Hepatozoonosis, ranges from subclinical and chronic to severe and life-threatening. Clinical signs include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and anemia. H americanum is the causative agent of American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), a condition which is most commonly severe to fatal, with salient clinical features including fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, muscle atrophy, muscle and bone pain, lameness, and recumbency. H canis is typically diagnosed by observation of parasites within leukocytes or by PCR. Infections are most commonly treated with imidocarb dipropionate for 2–3 months. ACH infections may be diagnosed by clinical signs, PCR, observation of parasites or associated lesions in muscle biopsies, and radiographs. Treatment is with antibiotics and NSAIDs for 2 weeks, followed by daily decoquinate for at least 2 years. Etiology, Epidemiology, and Transmission | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (0) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Etiology, Epidemiology, and Transmission of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Old World hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne disease of wild and domestic canids caused by the protozoal agent Hepatozoon canis. The organism is transmitted by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. In North America, Hepatozoon americanum, causative agent of American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH) is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum, rather than by the brown dog tick. H canis and H americanum, although closely related, result in clinically distinct syndromes in infected dogs, and genetic and antigenic differences between the organisms further support their classification as distinct species.  H canis is reported in many regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, the Caribbean islands, Europe, and South America. Before 2008, H canis was not thought to infect canids in North America, despite the presence of R sanguineus, but molecular evidence has since emerged that suggests otherwise. Still, ACH remains the more common and severe form of canine hepatozoonosis in the United States. American canine hepatozoonosis is an emerging disease that has primarily spread north and east from the Gulf coast of Texas, where it was originally detected in 1978. The distribution of this parasite chiefly parallels the distribution of the Gulf coast tick, although sporadic cases have been reported from disparate geographic locations presumably due to travel history. The associated table indicates states in which H canis, H americanum, and concomitant H canis and H americanum infections have been reported in domestic dogs.  Table States in which H canis and H americanum infections in domestic dogs have been documented The mode of transmission of hepatozoonosis is not typical in the classical sense of a tickborne disease; like other species in the genus, H canis and H americanum infections occur when infected ticks, the definitive host, are ingested by canine hosts. Sporozoites released from the mature oocysts in the ticks' hemocoel enter canine hosts via the gut. Dogs can also develop ACH after eating paratenic (transport) hosts that contain cystozoites, a resting stage of H americanum encysted within tissues.  In general, immunocompetent dogs appear to tolerate infection with H canis very well. Although life-threatening infections have been reported, clinical signs associated with H canis infection are most often subclinical to mild. H americanum, however, causes severe clinical signs in most infected dogs, with death often occurring within 1–2 years without supportive therapies; immunosuppression or concurrent disease does not appear necessary to induce the severe syndrome.  Clinical Findings of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs H canis tissue stages reside within bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, and unlike ACH patients, dogs infected with the Old World parasite do not appear to be in pain at presentation; in dogs with overt disease, nonspecific clinical signs including fever, lethargy, depression, and anemia may be observed.  The tissue phases of H americanum induce pyogranulomatous inflammation, which results in clinical signs including fever, depression, weight loss, poor body condition, muscle atrophy, pain, and weakness; mucopurulent ocular discharge is common, and bloody diarrhea occurs occasionally. Fever, which may fluctuate with the waxing and waning of clinical signs, ranges from 102.7°–106°F (39.3°–41°C) and is unresponsive to antibiotics. Surprisingly, many dogs maintain a normal appetite if food is placed directly in front of them, but they often will not move to eat, apparently because of intense pain. Hyperesthesia, presumably due to severe inflammation within muscle and sometimes along bone, manifests as stiffness and reluctance to move, as well as cervical and/or truncal rigidity. Longterm sequelae include glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis.  Diagnosis of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Clinical evaluation and patient history  CBC and biochemistry panel  Cytology  PCR  Muscle biopsy and histologic evaluation  Bone radiography  Patient history of tick exposure, travel, and, in suspected ACH cases, predation on rodents or rabbits, are important factors to consider when forming a potential diagnosis of canine hepatozoonosis, in conjunction with clinical examination and laboratory testing. The most common abnormality on blood work in dogs infected with H canis is anemia. Serum chemistry abnormalities may include increased CK and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities as well as hypoproteinemia with polyclonal hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia. Parasitemia in dogs with clinical H canis infection is often quite high, and a diagnosis can readily be achieved by microscopic examination of Romanowsky-type stained blood films to visualize parasite-containing leukocytes or by PCR to detect parasite DNA in peripheral blood. Hepatitis, pneumonia, and glomerulonephritis associated with H canis tissue stages have been reported postmortem in some animals with extremely high parasitemia.  In dogs with ACH, the most consistent laboratory abnormality is a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with counts ranging from 20,000–200,000 cells/μL. This is typically a pronounced, mature neutrophilia, although a left shift may be present. A mild to moderate anemia is also common. The platelet count is typically normal to high. Serum chemistry abnormalities in ACH patients are similar to those occasionally observed in H canis patients. Definitive diagnosis of ACH in suspicious patients is made by finding rare gamonts in peripheral blood leukocytes, by occasional PCR detection of circulating parasite, or by identifying pathognomonic \"onion skin\" cysts or pyogranulomas in stained sections of biopsied muscle.  Although invasive, muscle biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing ACH, because parasites and associated lesions are often extensively distributed throughout muscle tissue (especially in areas with observable atrophy); multiple or sequential biopsies may be necessary in some animals.  Radiographs in ACH patients may show periosteal reactions involving any bone, including the skull and vertebrae. The lesions resemble those of hypertrophic osteopathy except that they tend to be proximal rather than distal, and often markedly obvious in long bones; the physiologic basis for bony proliferation animals with H americanum infection is unknown.  No commercially available serologic assays have been developed to detect canine hepatozoonosis infection. PCR methods detecting circulating Hepatozoon spp are available through several academic institutions, although the assays may lack sensitivity in diagnosing H americanum infections because of the typically low levels of parasitemia in ACH patients. Use of these molecular tests has revealed that hepatazoonosis caused by H canis is more common in North America than previously known.  Treatment of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Antiprotozoal therapy  Supportive care  Tick control products  Preventing predation  Hepatozoonosis is generally considered a lifelong infection in dogs. No known therapeutic regimen completely clears animals of the organisms. H canis infections are treated with imidocarb dipropionate, twice monthly, at 5–6 mg/kg, SC, until the parasite is no longer evident in blood smears for 2–3 consecutive months. Prognosis often depends on the degree of parasitemia; dogs with low parasitemia typically respond well to treatment, whereas those with high parasitemia may not, especially if afflicted by concurrent illness.  Remission of clinical signs associated with H americanum infection can usually be achieved through a 14-day course of combination therapy, referred to as TCP, which consists of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (15 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours), clindamycin (10 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours), and pyrimethamine (0.25 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours), or ponazuril (10 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours). Remission with these therapies alone is often temporary, with many dogs relapsing within 2–6 months. Decoquinate mixed in food at a dose of 10−20 mg/kg is given every 12 hours as an adjunct therapy to initial TCP or ponazuril treatment for at least 2 years to help prevent relapse. NSAIDs may be the best treatment for control of fever and pain, especially during the first few days of TCP or ponazuril therapy. Glucocorticoid administration should be avoided because, although steroids may provide temporary relief, longterm use can exacerbate disease.  Preventing access to ticks and discouraging predation are the most effective forms of control for hepatozoonosis. Predation presents a dual risk for acquiring ACH: prey captured or eaten by dogs could have infected ticks on their coats that would provide a source of sporozoites; additionally, the prey could contain cystozoites (at least in the case of H americanum) that are also infectious. Additionally, dogs diagnosed with hepatozoonosis should not be bred because transplacental transmission of H canis has been documented. Although vertical transmission of H americanum has not been reported, it may be possible.  There is no known zoonotic risk with hepatozoonosis.  Key Points Canine hepatozoonosis is caused by H canis and H americanum, which are tick-borne protozoan parasites causing distinct clinical manifestations in canine patients after infected ticks are ingested.  H canis infection often leads to mild to moderate clinical disease, with anemia in some cases, whereas H americanum infection often results in a severe clinical syndrome known as American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), with patients commonly exhibiting fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, intense pain, muscle atrophy, and elevated neutrophil counts.  Diagnosis of canine hepatozoonosis is often based on patient history, clinical signs, blood work and cytology, PCR of peripheral blood, and in the case of ACH, characteristic histopathologic lesions evident in biopsied muscle tissue.  H canis infections are treated with imidocarb dipropionate (5−6 mg/kg, SC) 2 times monthly for 2−3 consecutive months, whereas H americanum infections are treated with a 14-day combination antibiotic therapy (trimethoprim-sulfadiazine at 15 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours; clindamycin at 10 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours; and pyrimethamine at 0.25 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) or ponazuril (10 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours) followed by long-term decoquinate administration (10−20 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours, mixed in food); tick control products are recommended to help prevent infection.  Treatment regimens recommended for canine hepatozoonosis are not curative, and prognoses are considered guarded, especially for ACH patients. Clinical signs often abate with treatment and animals return to having a good quality of life. Trypanosomiasis in Animals ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomiasis | Transmission and Epidemiology | Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings and Lesions | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Surra | Dourine | Chagas Disease | Transmission and Epidemiology | Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings and Lesions | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Nonpathogenic Trypanosomes | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (2) Videos (0) Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomiasis Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis refers to a group of diseases caused by protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma and affects all domesticated animals. The major veterinary species are T congolense, T vivax, T brucei brucei, and T simiae. T brucei rhodesiense and T brucei gambiense are zoonotic, with people as the predominant host. For the animals mainly affected by these tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes and the geographic areas where tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis occurs, see Table: Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomes.  Table Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomes Cattle, sheep, and goats are infected, in order of importance, by T congolense, T vivax, and T brucei brucei. In pigs, T simiae is the most important. In dogs and cats, T brucei is probably the most important. It is difficult to assign an order of importance for horses and camels. T vivax is found outside tsetse-infested areas of sub-Saharan Africa, carried mechanically by biting flies.  The trypanosomes that cause tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in people, T brucei rhodesiense and T brucei gambiense, closely resemble T brucei brucei, and suitable precautions should be taken when working with such isolates. Domestic animals act as reservoirs of human infections.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Most tsetse transmission is cyclic and begins when blood from a trypanosome-infected animal is ingested by the fly. The trypanosome alters its surface coat, multiplies in the fly, then alters its surface coat again, and becomes infective. T brucei spp migrate within the tsetse from the gut and eventually to the salivary glands; the cycle for T congolense stops at the hypopharynx, and the salivary glands are not invaded; the entire cycle for T vivax occurs in the proboscis. Therefore, the location within the tsetse can be useful in identifying the parasite species. The animal-infective form in the tsetse salivary gland is referred to as the metacyclic form. The life cycle in the tsetse may be as short as 1 week with T vivax or extend to a few weeks for T brucei spp.  Tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are restricted to Africa from about latitude 15°N to 29°S. The 3 main species inhabit relatively distinct environments: G morsitans usually is found in savanna country, G palpalis prefers areas around rivers and lakes, and G fusca lives in high forest areas. All 3 species transmit trypanosomes, and all feed on various mammals.  Mechanical transmission can occur through tsetse or other biting flies. In the case of T vivax, Tabanus spp and other biting flies seem to be the primary mechanical vectors outside tsetse-endemic areas, as in Central and South America. Mechanical transmission requires only that blood containing infectious trypanosomes be transferred by bite from one animal to another.  Pathogenesis of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Infected tsetse inoculate metacyclic trypanosomes into the skin of animals, where the trypanosomes reside for a few days and cause localized inflammation (chancres). They enter the lymph and lymph nodes, then the bloodstream, where they divide rapidly by binary fission. In T congolense infection, the organisms attach to endothelial cells and localize in capillaries and small blood vessels. T brucei species and T vivax invade tissues and cause tissue damage in several organs.  The immune response is vigorous, and immune complexes cause inflammation, which contributes to fever and other signs and lesions of the disease. Antibodies against the surface-coat glycoproteins kill the trypanosomes. However, trypanosomes have a large family of genes that code for variable surface-coat glycoproteins that are switched in response to the antibody response, evading immunity. This antigenic variation results in persistence of the organism. Antigenic variation has prevented development of a protective vaccine and permits reinfections when animals are exposed to a new antigenic type.  Clinical Findings and Lesions of Trypanosomiasis in Animals The severity of trypanosomiasis varies with species and age of the animal infected and species of trypanosome involved. The incubation period is usually 1–4 weeks. The primary clinical signs are intermittent fever, anemia, and weight loss. Cattle usually have a chronic course with high mortality, especially if there is poor nutrition or other stress factors. Ruminants may gradually recover if the number of infected tsetse flies is low; however, stress results in relapse.  Necropsy findings vary and are nonspecific. In acute, fatal cases, extensive petechiation of the serosal membranes, especially in the peritoneal cavity, may occur. Also, the lymph nodes and spleen are usually swollen. In chronic cases, swollen lymph nodes, serous atrophy of fat, and anemia are seen.  Diagnosis of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Clinical evaluation  Serologic testing  Trypanosoma vivax, bovine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. Corrie Brown.  A presumptive diagnosis of trypanosomiasis is based on finding an anemic animal in poor condition in an endemic area. Confirmation depends on demonstrating trypanosomes in stained blood smears or wet mounts. The most sensitive rapid method is to examine a wet mount of the buffy coat area of a PCV tube after centrifugation, looking for motile parasites. Other infections that cause anemia and weight loss, such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis, and haemonchosis, should be excluded by examining a stained blood smear.  Various serologic tests measure antibody to trypanosomes, but their use is more suitable for herd and area screening than for individual diagnosis. Rapid agglutination tests to detect circulating trypanosome species-specific antigens in peripheral blood are available for both individual and herd diagnosis, although their reliability remains varied. Molecular techniques for trypanosome detection and differentiation have been developed, but they are not generally available for routine field use.  Treatment and Control of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Chemotherapeutics  Reduction of tsetse fly populations  Several drugs can be used for treatment ( see Table: Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals) of trypanosomiasis. Most have a narrow therapeutic index, which makes administration of the correct dose essential. Drug resistance occurs and should be considered in refractory cases.  Table Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals Control of trypanosomiasis can be exercised at several levels, including eradication of tsetse flies and use of prophylactic drugs. Tsetse flies can be partially controlled by frequent spraying and dipping of animals, aerial and ground spraying of insecticides on fly-breeding areas, use of insecticide-impregnated screens and targets, bush clearing, and other habitat removal methods. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been used with success in Zanzibar and may be used in other area-wide control operations after suppression of tsetse populations by insecticides. There is renewed international interest in large-scale tsetse eradication through the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) supported by the African Union. Animals can be given drugs prophylactically in areas with a high population of trypanosome-infected tsetse. Drug resistance must be carefully monitored by frequent blood examinations for trypanosomes in treated animals.  Several breeds of cattle and water buffalo have been identified that have innate resistance to trypanosomiasis and could play a valuable role in reducing the impact of the disease in these areas. However, resistance may be lost because of poor nutrition or heavy tsetse challenge.  Control is ideally achieved by combining methods to reduce the tsetse challenge and by enhancing host resistance with prophylactic drugs.  Surra (Trypanosoma evansi Infection) Surra is usually transmitted by other biting flies that are found within and outside tsetse fly areas. It is found in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Far East, and Central and South America. The distribution of T evansi in Africa extends into the tsetse areas, where differentiation from T brucei is difficult. It is essentially a disease of camels and horses, but all domestic animals are susceptible. The disease can be fatal, particularly in camels, horses, and dogs. T evansi in other animals appears to be nonpathogenic, and these animals serve as reservoirs of infection.  Transmission is primarily by biting flies, probably resulting from interrupted feedings. A few wild animals are susceptible to infection and may serve as reservoirs.  Pathogenesis, clinical findings, lesions, diagnosis, and treatment for surra are similar to those of the tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes.  Dourine Dourine is a chronic venereal disease of horses that is transmitted during coitus and caused by T equiperdum. The disease is recognized on the Mediterranean coast of Africa and in the Middle East, southern Africa, and South America; distribution is probably wider.  Signs of dourine may develop over weeks or months. Early signs include mucopurulent discharge from the urethra in stallions and from the vagina in mares, followed by gross edema of the genitalia. Later, characteristic plaques 2–10 cm in diameter appear on the skin, and the horse becomes progressively emaciated. Mortality in untreated cases is 50%–70%.  Demonstration of trypanosomes from urethral or vaginal discharges, skin plaques, or peripheral blood is difficult unless the material is centrifuged. Infected horses can be detected with the complement fixation test but only in areas where T evansi or T brucei are not found because they have common antigens. An ELISA test may become available for diagnosis.  In endemic areas, horses may be treated ( see Table: Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals). When eradication is required, strict control of breeding and elimination of stray horses has been successful. Alternatively, infected horses may be identified using the complement fixation test; euthanasia is mandatory.  Chagas Disease (Trypanosoma cruzi Infection) Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomine bugs and caused by T cruzi. All mammals are considered susceptible to infection, with infection demonstrated in >100 mammalian species. Avian species are not susceptible. The disease is best recognized in dogs and people, with dogs serving as a major domestic reservoir. Domestic pigs and cats can also be infected, but their role as reservoirs for human infection is limited. Wildlife reservoirs include opossums, armadillos, raccoons, woodrats, and nonhuman primates.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Chagas Disease in Animals Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries of South America, Central America, and Mexico, and is increasingly reported in the southern USA. Chagas was once confined to the Americas, but human and animal migration has resulted in distribution to Europe, where it is an emerging disease of Spain, Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, and England. Seropositivity in dogs in endemic regions can vary from 5%–92%. In some areas such as Venezuela, the seropositivity of dogs is similar to that of people, whereas in other areas, such as Campeche, Mexico, seropositivity can be higher in dogs than in people.  The nocturnal and hematophagous triatomine insects of the Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus genera serve as vectors for T cruzi. Common names include the “kissing bug,” “assassin bug,” “cone-nosed bug,” “vinchuca,” “chinche,” and “barbeiro.\" There are >130 species of triatomines in the Americas, and most are considered competent vectors. Insects take an infected blood meal ingesting extracellular T cruzi trypomastigotes. These differentiate in the midgut to epimastigotes and divide. Epimastigotes travel to the hindgut, where they differentiate back into metacyclic trypomastigotes. Infective metacyclic trypomastigotes are shed in insect feces.  In insectivorous animals, including dogs, consumption of infected bugs or materials contaminated with infected triatomine feces is a major mode of transmission. Remarkably, the opossum (Didelphis species) is a unique host for T cruzi, because the parasite can complete its entire life cycle without the need for a vector. T cruzi maturation occurs in the anal odoriferous glands, and infective trypomastigotes can be shed in feces or urine and ingested. Additional methods of transmission include transplacentally or via blood transfusions and organ transplant.  Pathogenesis of Chagas Disease in Animals Once metacyclic trypomastigotes enter the bloodstream, they actively invade many cell types, exiting the parasitophorous vacuole and becoming nonflagellated amastigotes. Intracellular amastigotes divide every 15–18 hours for 5–6 days. T cruzi transforms back into trypomastigotes and lyses the cell. Released trypomastigotes invade new cells. T cruzi has a tropism for cardiac and smooth muscle but can be found in numerous other tissues.  Clinical Findings and Lesions of Chagas Disease in Animals Chagas disease is divided into acute and chronic phases, with the chronic phase further subdivided into latent and symptomatic chronic disease. Incubation ranges from 5–42 days before acute disease. Acute infections may be asymptomatic or consist of nonspecific febrile illness with a chancre at the site of parasitic entry. Dogs may also present with regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Rarely, acute clinical myocarditis is seen. Parasitemia peaks 2–3 weeks after infection and dissipates after the first month as the organism moves to predominantly tissue-borne disease.  The latent phase can last for months to years. Chronic disease symptoms can include generalized weakness or sudden death. Symptomatic dogs commonly present with right-side congestive heart failure. This can progress to myocarditis, with arrhythmias and bilateral cardiac dilation. Histologic examination of cardiac muscle may contain unruptured pseudocysts without inflammation or contain ruptured pseudocysts with lymphocytic, monocytic, and/or neutrophilic inflammation. Death secondary to heart failure is common.  Diagnosis of Chagas Disease in Animals Direct examination of blood smear  Antibody testing  Diagnosis of Chagas disease can be made by visualization of the organism, detection of DNA, or antibody detection. Parasitemia during the acute phase allows for detection on a microscopy of a routine peripheral blood smear. Although samples can be tested for T cruzi DNA by PCR or cultured, these diagnostic tests are uncommon in the field. On Giemsa stain, T cruzi is an extracellular, C-shaped protozoan with a single flagellum.  Antibody testing is of primary importance during the chronic phase. Whole blood, plasma, or serum can be submitted. Testing methodologies include immunochromographic “dipstick,” immunofluorescent antibody, or ELISA. Notably, cross-reaction with antibodies to Leishmania species, another trypanosomatid, can occur. Because of cross-reactivity of serologic tests, testing with at least two different methodologies or antigens is recommended. Additionally, cardiac tissue in the chronic phase can be analyzed by PCR for T cruzi DNA or by immunohistochemical analysis for amastigotes.  Treatment and Control of Chagas Disease in Animals Chemotherapeutics  Vector control  Benznidazole is the drug of choice for treatment for Chagas disease, but nifurtimox can also be used. In dogs, benznidazole is administered at 5–10 mg/kg/day, PO, for 2 months. In the USA, both of these drugs lack FDA approval, and their use requires permission from the CDC as investigational protocols. Symptomatic treatment for heart failure and arrhythmias is also recommended.  No vaccine for Chagas disease is available; thus, control focuses on preventing disease transmission. Vector control methods include applying pesticides to eliminate triatomine vectors and decreasing vector attraction to dwellings at night by turning off outdoor lighting. Breeding of positive bitches is discouraged. Screening of blood donors is recommended. To avoid iatrogenic transmission, disinfection with 10% bleach or 70% ethanol is suggested for contaminated surfaces. Dead infected insects can remain a source of infective T cruzi for up to 6 days at 10°C or up to 2 months at 26°–30°C.  Nonpathogenic Trypanosomes Trypanosoma theileri or markedly similar trypanosomes have been detected in peripheral blood from cattle on every continent. Infection with similar trypanosomes also has been detected in domestic and wild buffalo and various other wild ungulates. In the few areas studied, transmission is by contamination after a cycle of development in species of tabanid flies. Although most parasitemias are subpatent, the trypanosomes may be seen in a blood smear being examined for pathogenic protozoa or in a hemocytometer chamber. Pathogenicity has never been proved experimentally.  T melophagium of sheep also has a worldwide distribution and is transmitted by the sheep ked. T theodori, reported in goats, may be a synonym for the same trypanosome. Lymphoma in Dogs (Canine Lymphoma, Lymphosarcoma in Dogs) ByTimothy M. Fan, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Sept 2023 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Dogs with lymphoma (a cancer of malignant lymphocytes) most commonly develop nonpainful, generalized lymphadenopathy. Clinical signs such as lethargy, weight loss, and constitutional decline can occur with more advanced disease. Lymphoma can be diagnosed by means of either fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation or lymph node biopsy with histologic evaluation. Molecular diagnostic techniques, including flow cytometry and PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) assay, can also be helpful. Treatment is systemic with chemotherapy. Etiology | Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (2) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Lymphoma (malignant lymphoma or lymphosarcoma) in dogs arises from the uncontrolled and pathological clonal expansion of lymphoid cells of either B-cell or T-cell immunophenotype. Usually primary and secondary lymphoid tissues are involved, including the bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen.  In addition to these lymphoid-rich organs, extranodal sites that lymphoma affects include the skin, intestinal tract, liver, eye, CNS, and bone.  Etiology of Lymphoma in Dogs The underlying causes of malignant lymphoma in dogs remain incompletely characterized, and it is likely multifactorial. Potential contributing factors include infectious viruses or bacteria, environmental contamination with phenoxyacetic acid herbicides or other chemical exposures, strong magnetic fields, chromosomal abnormalities, and immune dysfunction.  Advanced genetic studies have revealed that lymphoma in dogs can be molecularly distinguished and categorized into discrete groups that correlate with biological aggressiveness.  Epidemiology of Lymphoma in Dogs Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic neoplasm in dogs, with a reported incidence approaching 0.1% of susceptible dogs.  Lymphoma in dogs usually occurs in middle-aged to older dogs. There is no significant association with sex. Some breeds may be at increased relative risk (eg, Boxer, Rottweiler, Golden Retriever); however, any breed can be affected.  Clinical Findings of Lymphoma in Dogs In dogs, lymphoma is a heterogeneous cancer, with variable clinical signs, responses to treatment, and survival times. The heterogeneity associated with canine lymphoma is influenced in part by several tumor and host factors, including anatomical involvement, extent of disease, morphological subtype, host constitution, and immunocompetence.  The most common clinical forms of canine lymphoma are high-grade T-cell or B-cell variants, which manifest as generalized, nonpainful, peripheral lymphadenopathy in 80%–85% of cases. Less commonly, lymphoma primarily affects other organ systems, including the alimentary tract, skin, mediastinum, and other extranodal sites.  In dogs with substantial tumor burden or paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, systemic constitutional signs, including profound lethargy, weakness, fever, anorexia, and dehydration, may become severe and life-limiting.  Alimentary lymphoma accounts for < 10% of all cases of canine lymphoma. Dogs with focal intestinal lesions may exhibit clinical signs consistent with partial or complete luminal obstruction (eg, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain). With diffuse involvement of the intestinal tract, dogs with alimentary lymphoma may show marked and debilitating GI disturbances, including anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypoproteinemia, and weight loss secondary to malabsorption and maldigestion.  Exclusive involvement of the cranial mediastinum characterizes only a small fraction of lymphoma cases. Typically, canine lymphoma is characterized by enlargement of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes, thymus, or both. Mediastinal lymphoma arising from the thymus is predominantly high-grade malignant T-cell lymphoma. With advanced disease, clinical signs may include respiratory distress associated with pleural fluid accumulation, direct compression of adjacent lung lobes, or cranial vena cava syndrome.  In addition to respiratory signs, some dogs with mediastinal lymphoma may have primary polyuria with secondary polydipsia resulting from humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs in 10%–40% of dogs with lymphoma. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy can be confirmed by measurement of the concentrations of ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) in circulating blood.  Cutaneous lymphoma, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Louis-Philippe de Lorimier.  The most common extranodal form of lymphoma involves the skin (ie, cutaneous lymphoma). Lesions associated with cutaneous lymphoma (epitheliotropic and nonepitheliotropic) may appear as solitary, raised, ulcerative nodules or generalized, diffuse, scaly lesions. The peripheral lymph nodes and mucocutaneous junctions are often involved.  Clinical signs associated with lymphoma that involve other extranodal sites may include respiratory distress (lungs), renal failure (kidneys), blindness (eyes), seizures (CNS), and skeletal pain or pathological fracture (bone).  Although the most commonly diagnosed type of lymphoma in dogs is high-grade lymphoma of either B-cell or T-cell origin, low-grade (indolent) lymphoma is a molecular variant. Indolent lymphoma consists of several histopathologic subtypes, including marginal-zone, follicular, mantle-cell, and T-zone lymphomas.  Indolent lymphomas most commonly involve the spleen or lymph nodes; generally, the clinical progression is slow. Dogs with indolent lymphomas often remain subclinically affected for a prolonged time, regardless of treatment.  Lesions Commonly, peripheral and various internal lymph nodes are 3–10 times normal size (multicentric form) in canine lymphoma, and nonpainful on digital palpation. Affected nodes are initially freely movable but firm. With disease progression, however, lymph nodes can become fixed and compress surrounding normal structures, leading to discomfort or functional compromise.  Histologically, effaced lymph nodes are gray to tan in coloration, and when transected, they bulge and lose cortical-medullary demarcation. Frequently, there is hepatosplenomegaly, with either diffuse enlargement or multiple, pale nodules of variable size disseminated in the parenchyma.  In the alimentary form of canine lymphoma, any part of the GI tract or mesenteric lymph nodes may be affected.  Involvement of the bone marrow, CNS, kidney, heart, tonsils, pancreas, and eyes is possible but less common.  Diagnosis of Lymphoma in Dogs Clinical evaluation  Fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation  Tissue biopsy with histologic evaluation  Molecular diagnostic techniques  On clinical examination, generalized, nonpainful lymphadenopathy should raise suspicion for multicentric lymphoma.  Fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation is a highly effective and practical method for identifying pathological monomorphic populations of lymphoid cells. Cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma depends on the proportions of large (lymphoblastic), intermediate, and small (lymphocytic) lymphocytes assessed on multiple well-made, highly cellular fine-needle aspirate smears sampled from an entire lymph node or from multiple lymph nodes.  Fine-needle aspirate smear, Labrador Retriever   Image Image courtesy of Dr. Michael Rosser.  The key cytologic hallmark of most lymphomas in dogs is a cell population composed predominantly of a relatively homogeneous population of monomorphic, medium to large lymphocytes. Cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma involving small or intermediate lymphocytes can be more challenging, necessitating biopsy or molecular diagnostic testing.  Historically, histologic evaluation of tissue biopsy samples has been the gold-standard diagnostic test for morphological subtyping of canine lymphoma (diffuse versus follicular, cleaved versus noncleaved) and histologic grade (high versus low). Immunophenotyping enables further categorization of lymphomas by immunohistochemical staining into B-cell (CD79a) or T-cell (CD3) types.  Molecular diagnostic techniques may be helpful in the diagnosis of lymphoma in dogs.  Flow cytometry permits definitive diagnosis of lymphoma based on physical characteristics including size, complexity, and expression of surface markers such as CD markers (clusters of differentiation or classification determinants).  The PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) assay enables the determination of clonality and is a sensitive method for confirming the neoplastic origin of lymphocytes and a diagnosis of lymphoma.  Staging Once a diagnosis of lymphoma has been established, clinical staging is performed to assess the extent of disease. Diagnostic imaging and assessment of bone marrow involvement may be necessary to ascertain the stage of disease. The WHO staging scheme is routinely used to stage lymphoma in dogs (see the table WHO Clinical Staging System for Lymphoma in Domestic Animals).  Table WHO Clinical Staging System for Lymphoma in Domestic Animals Treatment of Lymphoma in Dogs Systemic chemotherapy  Radiotherapy  Autologous bone marrow transplant  Given that only a small fraction of dogs achieve a cure with conventional treatment options, the primary goal for treatment is palliative.  Canine lymphoma is generally responsive to conventional systemic chemotherapy (initial response rate ≥ 90%); most dogs achieve improved quality of life and greater overall survival time. However (except in some forms of indolent lymphoma), eventual disease relapse is expected in most dogs, with disease that progressively becomes refractory to continued treatment.  In the treatment of high-grade lymphoma in dogs, the most common chemotherapeutic agents administered in combination protocols are cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), vincristine, and prednisone (ie, CHOP-based protocols; the \"O\" in \"CHOP\" comes from one trade name for vincristine). The addition of l-asparaginase is optional; often, this drug is reserved for clinically ill dogs or cases of relapse.  Other common chemotherapeutic agents with activity against naive and relapsing lymphoma include lomustine, mitoxantrone, and rabacfosadine.  With systemic multidrug chemotherapy protocols, median survival times in dogs are ~12 months for B-cell lymphoma and ~6–8 months for T-cell lymphoma.  Compared with combination protocols, single-agent chemotherapy, with the exception of doxorubicin treatment, does not typically achieve durable remission. Doxorubicin monotherapy can achieve complete remission, with a median survival time of 6–8 months, albeit with lower response rates than CHOP-based protocols achieve. Extravasation of doxorubicin can be catastrophic, and especially in dogs, cumulative cardiotoxicity results in a lifetime dose limit.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Extravasation of doxorubicin can be catastrophic, and especially in dogs, cumulative cardiotoxicity results in a lifetime dose limit.  Prednisone monotherapy can improve quality of life and can induce remission for a time (typically 1–2 months, but some dogs can have better outcomes). However, multidrug resistance can develop.  As of 2021, the FDA had conditionally approved verdinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) antineoplastic drug, for treatment of canine lymphoma. Response rates and durations appear to be lower than with available systemic multidrug chemotherapy protocols. Experience with this novel drug remains limited; however, it may provide an additional option for treatment in some dogs.  With no treatment, dogs die or are euthanized within 4–6 weeks.  Inclusion of half-body radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy might improve the longterm control of canine lymphoma.  In autologous bone marrow transplants, malignant lymphoma cells are ablated with intensive chemoradiation strategies, and reinfusion of autologous bone marrow cells secondarily rescues the patient's hematopoietic system. This aggressive treatment is available at select institutions.  Despite the favorable outcomes expected in treating high-grade multicentric lymphoma, the successful management of other anatomical forms of lymphoma is often more difficult and less rewarding.  Alimentary lymphoma, if focal, can be treated effectively with surgical resection and combination chemotherapy. However, diffuse involvement of the intestinal tract, low constitutional reserve, severe malabsorption of nutrients, and loss of proteins often result in poor clinical responses and short survival times (< 3 months).  For mediastinal lymphoma, chemotherapy alone or combined with focal ionizing radiotherapy (in patients that might have appreciable pleural effusion or space-occupying complications—ie, those with associated dyspnea) can achieve favorable survival times and good quality of life.  Cutaneous lymphoma can be controlled for limited amounts of time, often < 3–6 months, by treatment with lomustine, doxorubicin, or rabacfosadine, or a combination protocol.  For indolent lymphoma, low-intensity oral chemotherapy protocols (chlorambucil and prednisone) often provide prolonged survival times (> 2 years).  In some dogs with localized and low-grade disease (eg, splenic involvement), splenectomy can be an effective treatment option without requiring adjuvant chemotherapy. (Also see Targeted Antineoplastic Agents.)  Key Points Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic tumor affecting dogs.  Lymphoma in dogs is often diagnosed through a combination of findings on physical examination and cytologic evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of enlarged lymph nodes.  Most dogs with lymphoma respond positively to systemic chemotherapy, with improved quality of life and overall survival time.  Although most lymphomas in dogs are multicentric, large B-cell tumors, lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease, and thorough diagnostic testing and categorization can influence treatment recommendations and prognosis. Overview of Hemostatic Disorders in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Physiological Understanding of Hemostasis | Clinical Approach to Assessing Hemostasis | Key Points | For More Information | References Effective hemostasis depends on an adequate number of functional platelets, an adequate concentration and activity of plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins, and a normally responsive blood vasculature. The diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of hypo- and hypercoagulable animals is difficult with regard to both the progression of disease and the monitoring of blood component and/or anticoagulant therapy.  Citrated plasma samples are often used in veterinary medicine to determine fibrinogen concentration, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and D-dimer or fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) concentration.  The introduction of the cell-based tissue factor (TF)/factor VII–dependent model of hemostasis has enhanced understanding of the complex biochemistry of physiological hemostasis, leading to reevaluation of the traditional cascade model of physiological hemostasis, which divides coagulation into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.  Although citrated plasma contains many of the factors involved in coagulation, whole blood contains not only these soluble factors but also the cellular components (eg, TF and phospholipid) that participate in normal and pathological hemostasis.  Physiological Understanding of Hemostasis in Animals The traditional model of hemostasis, known as the cascade or waterfall model, divides coagulation proteins into an extrinsic and an intrinsic arm or pathway, both of which lead to a final, common pathway ending in formation of fibrin. This model offers a simplified understanding of how factors activate one another; however, it might not accurately reflect complex and overlapping interactions of procoagulant elements, especially the importance of cell surfaces.  Pearls & Pitfalls  The cascade model of hemostasis simplifies the complex and overlapping interactions of procoagulant elements but may not be as biologically accurate as the cell-based model.  The cell-based model of hemostasis has been introduced to explain hemostasis through the interaction of vascular tone, blood flow, endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes, as well as coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, cofactors, and inhibitors (1). These interactions, under normal circumstances, result in balanced hemostasis, ensuring that there is formation of a clot at an injured site, inhibition of clotting when not needed, and fibrinolysis of clots when appropriate.  This dynamic model involves cellular regulation of coagulation in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation.  Initiation: TF-bearing cells initiate hemostasis. TF (factor III) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor found in extravascular tissues, including organ capsules and the adventitia of blood vessel walls. It is constitutively expressed on fibroblasts, and upon cellular activation it is also expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. The TF-bearing cells and platelet surfaces act as the main surfaces for assembly of procoagulant complexes.  Any vessel injury leads to TF exposure. Factor VII binds to TF, resulting in activation to factor VIIa. Factor VIIa that is bound to TF on the cell surface, the \"extrinsic tenase complex,\" activates factor IX to factor IXa and factor X to factor Xa. Initially, the formed factor Xa is limited to the TF-bearing cell because factor Xa that diffuses away from the cell is rapidly inhibited by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) or antithrombin.  Amplification: Factors Va and Xa assemble into the \"prothrombinase complex\" on the surface of the TF-bearing cell. A small, priming amount of factor IIa (thrombin) is initially generated close to the cell. This small amount of thrombin is not enough to lead to clot formation; however, it amplifies clot-forming elements by activating platelets to release factor V, causing von Willebrand factor to release factor VIII, and activating factors V, VIII, and XI.  Platelets are also activated by other mechanisms, including exposure of vessel wall collagen and von Willebrand factor, leading to platelet adhesion and aggregation at the injured site. Activated platelets aggregate to form the initial platelet plug that precedes the fibrin clot.  Propagation: As an essential part of platelet activation, the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine becomes available on the exterior surface of platelets. In the propagation phase of the cell-based model, the binding of factor IXa to activated platelets promotes formation of the \"intrinsic tenase complex\" of factor IXa, factor VIIIa, phosphatidylserine, and calcium.  Factor IXa activated during the initiation phase by the interaction of factor VIIa and TF-bearing cells is able to diffuse to the surface of activated platelets because it is not inhibited by TFPI and is only slowly inhibited by antithrombin.  Factor IX can also be activated on the surface of platelets by factor XIa. Formation of the intrinsic tenase complex on the surface of activated platelets results in abundant factor Xa formation. As in the amplification phase, factor Xa complexes with factor Va, forming the \"prothrombinase complex\" on the surface of activated platelets and leading to the cleavage of factor II (prothrombin) and a major subsequent burst of factor IIa (thrombin). Thrombin cleaves factor I (fibrinogen) to factor Ia (fibrin), forming a fibrin clot.  The thrombin burst in the propagation phase activates plasmin, thereby initiating fibrinolysis, which keeps the clot controlled at the site of injury. To control fibrinolysis, the antifibrinolytic pathway is activated by thrombin activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). TAFI slows the fibrinolytic process by inhibiting plasmin activity, thereby preventing premature clot lysis and enabling clot propagation.  The balance of fibrin formation and fibrinolysis regulates the size and quality of the fibrin clot and localizes it to the injury site. The quality of the clot has a marked impact on how effectively it provides hemostasis.  Clinical Approach to Assessing Hemostasis in Animals Although the traditional division between primary, secondary, and tertiary (fibrinolysis) hemostasis is not biologically accurate, it is still a useful approach to assessing hemostasis in animals with acquired or hereditary hemostatic disorders.  Primary hemostasis is accomplished by interaction of platelets with exposed subendothelial surfaces and results in a platelet plug. Simultaneously, plasma coagulation proteins are activated in a sequential cascade that depends on the phospholipid provided by the activated platelets and on calcium ions from plasma to form a stable fibrin clot (secondary hemostasis). Circumstances that activate platelets and the coagulation proteins also activate plasma fibrinolytic proteins, which ensure localization of the clot and its timely dissolution (tertiary hemostasis).  Tests of Primary Hemostasis Tests of primary hemostasis include in-clinic tests such as platelet count and buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT), as well as tests offered by reference laboratories, such as platelet closure time and von Willebrand factor (vWF) measurement.  Platelet counts can be estimated from peripheral blood smears. Platelets can be activated upon blood collection, leading to clumping and underestimated machine platelet counts, which emphasizes the importance of manual blood smear analysis. Apparent thrombocytopenia caused by in vitro platelet agglutination should not cause spontaneous bleeding.  Platelet counts can be lower than the reference range in clinically normal Greyhounds and other sight hound breeds. EDTA-induced platelet clumping occurs occasionally in dogs and horses (pseudothrombocytopenia), and cat platelets activate and clump readily during blood collection.  Buccal mucosal bleeding time is a point-of-care screening test commonly used to assess primary hemostasis in dogs. The lip is inverted, and a spring-loaded, automated lancet device produces a standardized incision on the mucosal side. Blood adjacent to the wound is gently blotted with absorbing paper every 5 seconds until bleeding stops. Canine BMBT is reported as normal (< 4 minutes) or abnormal. BMBT can also be measured in cats; however, the test is uncommonly used clinically, it usually requires sedation, and the technique and interpretation are not well standardized or documented (2).  Platelet closure time, measured by a platelet function analyzer, provides a quantitative, simple, and rapid in vitro assessment of primary platelet-related hemostasis at high shear stress. The test requires a small volume of citrated whole blood, which is drawn under vacuum through a 200-mcm-diameter stainless steel capillary and a 150-mcm-diameter aperture in a nitrocellulose membrane coated with collagen and epinephrine (CEPI) or collagen and ADP (CADP). A platelet aggregate forms that blocks blood flow through the aperture; the time taken to occlude the aperture is reported as the closure time.  Prolonged platelet closure times occur with inherited and acquired platelet function disorders, including von Willebrand disease. Platelet function analyzers also can be used to monitor response to treatment with both desmopressin acetate and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists.  Assays of canine vWF are typically required for diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and include measurement of vWF antigen concentration and collagen-binding assays for measurement of vWF activity.   Tests of Secondary Hemostasis Tests of secondary hemostasis include plasma-based assays measuring activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and prothrombin time (PT).  aPTT assesses factors of the intrinsic (XII, XI, IX, VIII) and common (X, V, II, I) pathways.  PT assesses factors of the extrinsic (VII) and common pathways.  Measurement of the activity of individual coagulation factors can identify additional specific factor deficits, helping to localize and define the problem in animals suspected of having hemostatic disease.  Tests of Tertiary Hemostasis The fibrinolytic system (tertiary hemostasis) is traditionally evaluated with measurements of clot breakdown products, such as FDPs and D dimers.  Endogenous anticoagulant ability has been evaluated via the measurement of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S activity.  Viscoelastic Testing Plasma-based coagulation screening tests can help identify defective or deficient coagulation proteins. Although this traditional approach makes it possible to effectively and systematically localize causes of bleeding, it can be difficult from a clinical perspective to globally evaluate clotting disturbances that affect multiple stages of hemostasis, identify hypercoagulable states, and monitor the effect of anticoagulant or procoagulant treatment.  One reason for this difficulty might be that plasma-based tests of the secondary and tertiary systems target specific elements of the hemostatic system, thus potentially ignoring other factors that could substantially contribute to overall hemostatic capability in acquired disorders. Another plausible reason is the low sensitivity of aPTT and PT; usually, activity of a coagulation protein must be < 30% and sometimes < 10% of normal before an abnormality is detected.  Viscoelastic testing, such as thromboelastography or thromboelastometry, enables rapid assessment of hemostatic function in whole blood. Because whole blood contains the soluble factors and cellular components involved in hemostasis, whole blood assays can provide a more accurate reflection of in vivo hemostasis than can traditional plasma-based hemostasis assays. These modalities evaluate all the steps of hemostasis, including initiation, amplification, and propagation, as well as fibrinolysis, which includes the interaction of platelets and leukocytes with the proteins of the coagulation cascade.  Viscoelastic testing modalities evaluate both the traditional plasma components of coagulation and the cellular components. Viscoelastic testing is performed on unstabilized fresh whole blood within minutes of taking a blood sample, and coagulation pathways are assessed after chemical activators have been added to the sample. Viscoelastic testing modalities analyze the dynamics of clot formation time, clot strength, and clot breakdown.  Viscoelastic testing is the first modality available to clinicians that can evaluate hypercoagulability. It is a valuable aid in the diagnostic evaluation of animals with abnormal hemostasis and a supplement to traditional coagulation tests such as PT, aPTT, D-dimer, and fibrinogen assays.  Point-of-care viscoelastic testing machines are becoming more widely available, and abundant emerging research seeks to translate observations from various viscoelastic testing modalities into clinically meaningful information for a variety of hyper- and hypocoagulable disorders in a variety of species.  Key Points The primary stage of hemostasis requires normal number and function of platelets and von Willebrand factor to form a plug.  In secondary hemostasis, a fibrin clot forms via TF-bearing cells, activated platelet surfaces, and clotting factors. The extent of the clot is controlled by fibrinolysis (tertiary hemostasis).  Traditional evaluation of coagulation could involve a combination of tests of primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. Viscoelastic testing enables a more global assessment of interacting hemostatic pathways.

Congenital or acquired defects or deficiencies of platelets usually manifest as superficial petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages (especially of mucous membranes), epistaxis, melena, or prolonged bleeding at injection and incision sites.  Congenital or acquired deficiencies of coagulation proteins usually manifest clinically as delayed or recurring deep tissue hemorrhage, hematoma formation, and bleeding into joints and body cavities. Petechiae generally do not occur in conditions caused by abnormalities in coagulation proteins.  Pathological thrombosis can result from primary or inherited disorders of anticoagulant protein factors or, more commonly, from acquired disorders. Collectively, these conditions are called hypercoagulable states.  Syndromes, such as DIC, that enhance platelet responsiveness to agonists and alter the balance between anticoagulant and procoagulant protein factors or that increase the reactivity of endothelium are always secondary to another disease or injury that must be recognized and treated for a successful outcome. DIC is more common in animals than are inherited disorders.  For More Information eClinPath.com (Cornell University): Hemostasis: Disorders  Goggs R, Blais M-C, Brainard BM, et al.

Acquired thrombocytopenia is the most common.  Congenital Thrombocytopenia in Animals Hereditary Macrothrombocytopenia Hereditary macrothrombocytopenia is a benign, inherited giant platelet disorder that affects approximately 30–50% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It has been identified in numerous other dog breeds as well, including Norfolk and Cairn terriers. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia with macrothrombocytes resulting from mutations in the beta-1-tubulin gene, which encodes a protein necessary for megakaryocyte division into platelets of normal size.  The disorder is suspected in dogs with persistently low platelet counts on routine CBCs, in the absence of bleeding, and it does not require intervention. Affected dogs commonly have platelet counts in the range of 50,000–100,000/mcL, or lower, depending on the accuracy of the analyzer and the condition of the sample. Hereditary macrothrombocytopenia must be differentiated from thrombocytopenia that is due to pathological causes.  Genetic testing is available and can be valuable to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment (and associated costs and worry) that may be given for pathological causes of thrombocytopenia.  Cyclic Hematopoiesis (Gray Collie Syndrome) Cyclic hematopoiesis is an autosomal recessive disorder that was originally identified in Collies and has rarely been reported in dogs of other breeds. It is also known as \"gray Collie syndrome\" because affected Collies have abnormal, dark pewter-gray to silver coat pigmentation (1, 2, 3).  Cyclic hematopoiesis is characterized by a mutation in the canine AP3B1 gene that results in 12-day cycles of cytopenia.  All marrow stem cells are affected; however, neutrophils are the most affected because of their short half-life (usually < 24 hours). Mild to severe thrombocytopenia can occur, and excessive bleeding is a potential complication.  Cyclic hematopoiesis is fatal; affected dogs usually die from fulminating infections before they are 6 months old. Even dogs that receive intensive antimicrobial treatment usually die by the age of 3 years, with amyloidosis secondary to chronic antigenic stimulation from recurrent infections.  Treatment with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been found to be successful in temporarily alleviating the neutropenic cycles until antibodies are produced against the noncanine proteins (4).  Collie breeders have successfully minimized the occurrence of cyclic hematopoiesis, and it exists now mostly in laboratory animals used for the study of hematopoiesis.  Genetic testing is available to enable early detection and subsequent monitoring in an individual animal; it could also help breeders identify carriers.  Fetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is a rare disorder that occurs when maternal antibodies are produced against a paternal antigen on fetal platelets.  Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia has been reported in a 1-day-old Quarter Horse foal. In the reported case, indirect assays identified immunoglobulins bound to the foal’s platelets in the mare’s plasma, serum, and milk. The immunoglobulins were further shown to recognize platelets from the foal’s full brother, born 1 year earlier (5). This diagnosis should be considered for foals with severe thrombocytopenia when other causes can be excluded.  A group of lambs artificially reared and fed bovine colostrum developed subcutaneous bruising, weakness, pale mucous membranes, and severe thrombocytopenia with prolonged bleeding from puncture wounds due to ear tag placement. All affected lambs died within 48 hours of birth. The presence of antibodies directed against platelets was suspected because the cows from which colostrum was obtained had been used in a previous experiment in which they had been immunized against sheep blood (6).  Acquired Thrombocytopenia in Animals Acquired thrombocytopenia is reported frequently in dogs and cats, less often in horses, and rarely in other species. Frequently, thrombocytopenia is secondary to a broader systemic process in clinically ill animals, and artifactually low machine platelet counts are common in animals.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Spontaneous bleeding due to thrombocytopenia does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 30,000/mcL.  Spontaneous bleeding due to thrombocytopenia does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 30,000/mcL. Hemorrhage from trauma (eg, venipuncture, organ aspirates, surgery) does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 50,000/mcL.  If spontaneous bleeding or surgical bleeding complications occur in the face of a platelet count above the minimum platelet count threshold, multifactorial coagulation abnormalities should be considered.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Hemorrhage from trauma does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 50,000/mcL.  Causes of acquired thrombocytopenia can broadly result from increased platelet consumption (to stop hemorrhage or in pathological thrombosis), accelerated destruction, lack of production, or sequestration in the spleen.  Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by immune-mediated destruction of either circulating platelets or, less commonly, marrow megakaryocytes. It has been reported in dogs, horses, and, rarely, cats. Middle-aged female dogs, especially Cocker Spaniels, are overrepresented.  Clinical signs of ITP include petechiae of the gingivae or skin, as well as ecchymosis, melena, hematuria, ocular bleeding, and/or epistaxis. Some dogs with extremely low platelet counts remain clinically unaffected. Platelet counts are usually < 30,000/mcL and often < 10,000/mcL at the time of diagnosis.  ITP can be classified as either primary (with no identifiable trigger) or secondary to a wide variety of infections (particularly vector-borne infections), drugs, and neoplastic or inflammatory diseases. There is little evidence to support vaccination as a cause of ITP in dogs; however, it might be in rare instances.  A variety of tests have been developed to prove the presence of antiplatelet antibodies; however, none have shown dependable sensitivity and specificity.  ITP diagnosis is usually based on the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia in a patient with verifiable and severe thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate can help determine whether megakaryocytes have been targeted; it is rarely needed, though, because marrow megakaryocytes are less commonly the target, and treatment and prognosis are similar whether or not megakaryocytes are decreased.  Patients with ITP should be kept at rest to avoid exacerbating bleeding tendencies.  Treatment involves immunosuppression, often initially by corticosteroid administration, starting at a high dose and then tapering (as in the treatment of hemolytic anemia). A single injection of vincristine (0.01–0.02 mg/kg, IV) at the start of treatment has been shown to shorten the time to recovery of the platelet count (7). Dogs that received prednisone and vincristine had a significantly faster increase in platelet count to > 40,000 platelets/mcL than dogs that received prednisone alone (mean +/- SD, 4.9 +/- 1.1 vs 6.8 +/- 4.5 days, respectively).  Alternative immunosuppressive drugs (eg, modified cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil) are sometimes used (in addition to corticosteroids) to minimize longterm reliance on corticosteroids and/or for refractory or relapsing cases.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Whole blood and platelet transfusions will not normalize platelet numbers, but they might slow ongoing platelet consumption in patients with severe, life-threatening bleeding.  Transfusion with fresh whole blood or packed RBCs should be performed in animals with clinical signs related to anemia. Whole blood and platelet transfusions will not normalize platelet numbers; however, they might help to slow the ongoing, consumptive siphon for platelets in patients with severe and life-threatening bleeding.  Therapeutic plasma exchange has been described for the treatment of ITP in dogs (8) and could be an option at referral centers offering this form of therapy. Splenectomy should be reserved as a treatment for animals that have recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Splenectomy should be considered only in animals that have recurrent or refractory thrombocytopenia.  The platelet count should be monitored while immunosuppressive medications are slowly tapered (over a period of 4–6 months or longer) because relapses can occur. Drugs that interfere with coagulation should be avoided.  Rickettsial Diseases Infections caused by Rickettsia rickettsii (the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever), Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia ewingii, or Ehrlichia canis, which are transmitted by ticks, cause mild to severe thrombocytopenia in dogs.  A platys infection usually is characterized by mild, often cyclic thrombocytopenia in the acute stages of disease. Chronic infections often involve constant mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Morulas (single to multiple, round to oval basophilic inclusions) can sometimes be identified in platelets of infected dogs. Thrombocytopenia due to A platys is seldom severe enough to result in clinical bleeding tendencies.  E canis infections are characterized by variable alterations in total WBC, RBC, and platelet counts. Acute infections usually involve thrombocytopenia, and possibly anemia or leukopenia. Chronic infections sometimes involve thrombocytopenia or anemia; also there is often leukopenia and sometimes hyperglobulinemia (monoclonal or polyclonal).  A phagocytophilum infection has been documented in a wide variety of domestic and wild animals. It is characterized by bleeding, fever, lethargy, and a reluctance to move. Changes in blood parameters include thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Morulas can occur in granulocytes.  Treatment for these rickettsial infections is doxycycline. Chronic E canis infections might not respond well; however, some dogs can survive without clinical signs despite subnormal RBC, WBC, and platelet counts, especially in endemic areas.  Neoplasia In addition to other mechanisms for causing thrombocytopenia, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma, and carcinoma can be associated with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to DIC. Immunological and inflammatory mechanisms cause increased platelet consumption and decreased platelet survival time. However, bleeding tendencies without thrombocytopenia occasionally occur. Altered platelet function due to an acquired membrane defect has been associated with hyperglobulinemia. Vasculitis also can contribute to the hemostatic disorder.  Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia associated with the administration of certain drugs has been reported in dogs, cats, and horses. One mechanism is marrow suppression of megakaryocytes or generalized marrow stem cell suppression (after administration of estrogen, chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital, or sulfonamides). Another mechanism is increased platelet destruction and consumption (after administration of sulfisoxazole, aspirin, diphenylhydantoin, ristocetin, levamisole, methicillin, or penicillin).  Drug reactions are idiosyncratic and therefore unpredictable. Platelets usually return to normal shortly after the drug is discontinued. Drug-induced bone marrow suppression can be prolonged. The chemotherapy drug lomustine has sometimes caused prolonged thrombocytopenia that persists after the drug is stopped.  Other Causes of Thrombocytopenia Many infectious and inflammatory diseases can lead to vasculitis, platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia. Platelet count can be low if platelets are consumed during appropriate clotting to try to stop a hemorrhage, as in trauma or disorders of secondary hemostasis. They can also be consumed during pathological thrombosis (such as hypercoagulable states or DIC). Platelet count can be low with a variety of bone marrow disorders, including toxicoses, infections, myelofibrosis, or myelophthisis, with or without other cytopenias.  Quantitative platelet disorders have been reported in liver disease with or without coagulation protein deficiencies.  In two studies of cats with thrombocytopenia, 29–50% had infectious diseases, including feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, panleukopenia, or toxoplasmosis (9, 10).  Feline leukemia virus replicates and accumulates in megakaryocytes and platelets. Aplasia or hypoplasia of marrow stem cells, immune destruction of infected platelets, or extravascular sequestration of platelets within lymphoid tissues can contribute to thrombocytopenia in cases of feline leukemia virus infection.  Intravascular parasites can also cause platelet activation and removal.  Bovine viral diarrhea virus can cause thrombocytopenia in cattle.  Platelets can be sequestered in the spleen when the spleen is congested, such as during sedation or anesthesia.  The mechanism of thrombocytopenia is not identified in many cases.  Congenital Platelet Function Disorders in Animals Congenital disorders of platelet function affect platelet adhesion, aggregation, or secretion. They can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to platelets.  Testing of intrinsic platelet function requires careful handling of samples and specialized equipment that is not routinely available in diagnostic laboratories; therefore, the incidence of intrinsic functional defects in platelets is not accurately known. However, if a coagulopathy exists (especially with petechiae or mucosal bleeding) but results of coagulation screening, platelet count, and von Willebrand factor assessment are normal, then a platelet function disorder should be suspected.  There is no specific treatment for any intrinsic platelet function disorder. In instances of severe hemorrhaging, platelet transfusion products can be administered to aid hemostasis. Whole blood or packed RBCs can be administered to patients with clinical signs of anemia.  Von Willebrand Disease Von Willebrand disease, caused by defective or deficient von Willebrand factor (vWF, formerly called factor VIII–related antigen), is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs (reported in nearly all breeds and in mixed breeds). The disease has been reported also in cats, rabbits, cattle, horses, and pigs.  The disease is relatively common (10–70% prevalence) in several breeds of dogs: Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd Dog, Golden Retriever, Miniature Schnauzer, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shetland Sheepdog, Basset Hound, Scottish Terrier, Standard Poodle, and Standard Manchester Terrier. Many dogs with von Willebrand disease are subclinically affected.  Canine von Willebrand disease is classified into three subtypes based on clinical severity, plasma vWF concentration, and vWF multimer composition:  Type 1, the most common form, is characterized by mild to moderate clinical signs, low vWF concentration, and a normal multimer distribution.  Type 2 is characterized by moderate to severe clinical signs, low vWF concentration, and a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers.  Type 3, which occurs most commonly in Shetland Sheepdogs and Scottish Terriers, is a severe disorder characterized by total absence of vWF.  Two modes of inheritance for von Willebrand disease are known. In the less common autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, homozygosity is usually fatal, and heterozygosity results in subclinically affected carriers. In the more common inheritance pattern of autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance, homozygotes and heterozygotes can have variable bleeding tendencies.  Affected animals can have gingival bleeding, epistaxis, and hematuria. Some puppies bleed excessively only after injection, venipuncture, or surgery, such as tail docking, ear cropping, or dewclaw removal.  vWF circulates as a complex with coagulation factor VIII and mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial surfaces—the first step in clot formation. The most common clinical sign of von Willebrand disease is mucosal bleeding, usually without evidence of petechiae or bruising, which occurs postoperatively in some affected animals.  Von Willebrand disease should be suspected in animals with clinical signs of a platelet disorder, normal coagulation screening tests (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] and prothrombin time [PT]), adequate platelet counts, and long buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT). BMBT is a good screening test in dogs with signs of a platelet disorder and a normal platelet count.  Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of low vWF concentration in plasma or via DNA screening.  Occasionally, affected animals can have decreased factor VIII coagulant and therefore have prolonged aPTT and activated clotting time (ACT).  Drugs known to interfere with normal platelet function should be avoided in animals with suspected von Willebrand disease. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, or fresh whole blood effectively alleviates a bleeding episode.  Type 1 von Willebrand disease could respond to treatment with desmopressin acetate, which causes release of high-molecular-weight multimers from the endothelium. Desmopressin (1 mcg/kg, SC, 30 minutes before surgery, using a sterile solution) can be administered to these dogs before surgery to minimize bleeding complications.  Concomitant hemostatic abnormalities can exacerbate von Willebrand disease. Hypothyroidism was once thought to be associated with von Willebrand disease; both conditions are prevalent in many of the same dog breeds (eg, Doberman Pinschers and Golden Retrievers). Thyroid hormone supplementation in hypothyroid dogs without deficiency of vWF has been found not to increase vWF activity; in fact, in most of the tested dogs, vWF activity decreased (11). Therefore, levothyroxine cannot be recommended as a treatment for von Willebrand disease, and it might even exacerbate the disease.  Chédiak-Higashi Syndrome Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal granule formation in leukocytes, melanocytes, and platelets (see Morphologic Leukogram Abnormalities). The defect appears to be in microtubule formation; therefore, a decreased number of granules that are abnormally large are evident in numerous types of cells. Diluted coat color results from the defect in the melanocytes.  Leukocytes can have decreased functional ability to phagocytose and kill organisms (an inconsistent finding in animals), and platelets have decreased aggregation and release reactions. Platelets are almost devoid of dense granules and have markedly decreased storage quantities of adenosine diphosphate and serotonin.  Prolonged bleeding in blue smoke Persian cats with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome occurs after venipuncture or surgery. The syndrome also has been diagnosed in mink, cattle, and beige mice with similar bleeding tendencies.  Canine Thrombopathia Canine thrombopathia has been described in Basset Hounds and Landseers as well as some spitz-type dogs. Inheritance is autosomal with variable penetrance.  Platelets have abnormal fibrinogen receptor exposure and impaired dense granule release. Dogs with mucosal bleeding and petechiation that have normal platelet counts and vWF should be suspected of having thrombopathia.  Specific diagnosis of canine thrombopathia requires specialized platelet function testing.  Genetic tests are available for affected breeds to identify carriers and inform breeding.  Bovine Thrombopathia Bovine thrombopathia is an autosomally inherited platelet function defect of Simmental cattle. Bleeding can be mild to severe in affected cattle and is exacerbated by trauma or surgery. Platelets have impaired aggregation responses.  Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Glanzmann thrombasthenia (formerly called thrombasthenic thrombopathia) is an autosomally transmitted disorder that has been diagnosed in Otterhound and Great Pyrenees dogs and in Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse cross, Peruvian Paso, and Oldenburg horses.  Affected animals have prolonged BMBTs and form hematomas at sites of venipuncture or injury. Blood smears show numerous bizarre, giant platelets (30–80% of all platelets).  Because of decreased synthesis of either glycoprotein IIb or IIIa, the membrane receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is decreased or lacking on the surface of platelets. To date, all known affected animals have had a defect in IIb synthesis.  Blood from animals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia does not have normal clot retraction, and platelets do not aggregate normally after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate, collagen, or thrombin.  Canine Platelet Procoagulant Deficiency (Scott Syndrome) Canine platelet procoagulant deficiency (Scott syndrome) is an inherited bleeding disorder in which platelets are unable to exteriorize phosphatidylserine needed as a site of interaction for key clotting factors. This condition has been described rarely in German Shepherd Dogs and is characterized by postoperative hemorrhage and bruising.  Acquired Platelet Function Disorders in Animals Several diseases have been associated with acquired platelet function disorders. Hyperglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma induces a platelet membrane defect that results in impaired hemostatic function. In uremia associated with any form of renal disease, platelet adhesion and aggregation are decreased.  Liver disease can affect not only platelet number but also platelet function. Because the effects on procoagulant and anticoagulant clotting factors vary, bleeding tendencies are challenging to predict in patients with liver disease.  In addition to affecting platelet number, DIC impairs platelet aggregation.  Numerous drugs also can impair platelet function:  Drugs reported to block platelet receptor binding or to change platelet membrane charge or permeability include furosemide, penicillin, carbenicillin, lidocaine, phentolamine, and chlorpromazine.  Drugs that inhibit the transduction of messages received at the platelet surface include caffeine, theophylline, dipyridamole, and papaverine.  Drugs that inhibit the execution of platelet responses (aggregation, secretion, or thromboxane production) include aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, other NSAIDs, ticlopidine, pentobarbital, and sulfinpyrazone.  Clopidogrel and related drugs decrease ADP-induced platelet aggregation.  Key Points Clinical signs of platelet disorders include petechiae, ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding, and persistent oozing of blood after injury or surgery.  Thrombocytopenia is much more common than thrombopathia, with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia the most common cause of severe thrombocytopenia in dogs.  Von Willebrand disease is the most common cause of abnormal buccal mucosal bleeding time despite normal platelet count.  For More Information Lattimer KS (ed). Hemostasis.

Marked decreases in activity of coagulation proteins essential to hemostasis are usually fatal. With < 1% of normal activity, animals can be stillborn or die shortly after birth as a result of massive hemorrhage.  Insufficient production of coagulation proteins or limited access to vitamin K by the immature neonatal liver can exacerbate a coagulation defect.  If activity of any particular coagulation protein is 5–10% of normal, the neonate could survive; however, signs of a congenital coagulation disorder usually appear before the age of 6 months. It is during this time—when teething and routine procedures (eg, vaccination, castration, ovariohysterectomy) are usually performed—that a bleeding tendency can become apparent.  Most of the congenital coagulation protein disorders reported in domestic animals are deficiencies or abnormalities of a single factor.  Factor I (Fibrinogen) Deficiency Primary fibrinogen deficiency can be divided into afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and dysfibrinogenemia.  Congenital afibrinogenemia has been reported in a family of Saanen dairy goats. It has rarely been described in dogs and cats.  Hypofibrinogenemia, accompanied by severe bleeding, has been reported in Saint Bernards and Vizslas and in one mixed-breed dog; the activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) were prolonged.  Dysfibrinogenemia has been reported in an inbred family of Borzois. The ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT were prolonged; however, the presence of fibrinogen was revealed by quantitative testing. Affected dogs had mild bleeding episodes with epistaxis and lameness, but trauma or surgery resulted in life-threatening bleeding. To stop the bleeding, IV administration of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate is the best treatment.  Factor II (Prothrombin) Disorders Factor II (prothrombin) disorders are rare.  Boxers have been reported to have normal concentrations of abnormally functioning prothrombin. The defect is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.  A disorder of factor II has been reported in English Cocker Spaniels.  Clinical signs in affected puppies (epistaxis and gingival bleeding) decrease with age, and adults bruise easily or have dermatitis. In affected puppies, TT is normal, but ACT, aPTT, and PT are prolonged.  The treatment is transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or fresh whole blood, if RBCs are needed.  Factor VII Deficiency Factor VII deficiency has been reported in Beagles, English Bulldogs, Alaskan Malamutes, Alaskan Klee Kais, Miniature Schnauzers, Boxers, and mixed-breed dogs.  Factor VII deficiency is inherited in an autosomal pattern with incomplete dominance.  Usually, factor VII deficiency is not associated with spontaneous bleeding; however, affected dogs can have bruising or prolonged bleeding after surgery. Prolonged postpartum hemorrhaging has been reported.  Factor VII deficiency is usually diagnosed coincidentally when coagulation screening tests are performed. The PT is prolonged, whereas aPTT and other test results are normal.  Factor VIII Deficiency (Hemophilia A) Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs and cats. It has also been reported in several breeds of horses, including Arabians, Standardbreds, Quarter Horses, and Thoroughbreds.  There is an X-linked pattern of inheritance, so usually females are subclinically affected carriers and males are affected. Rarely, in highly inbred families, breeding of a carrier female with an affected male can produce affected female offspring.  In puppies with factor VIII deficiency, prolonged bleeding occurs from the umbilical vessels after birth; from the gingiva during tooth eruption; and after surgery such as tail docking, dewclaw removal, or ear cropping.  Hemarthrosis accompanied by intermittent lameness, spontaneous hematoma formation, and hemorrhagic body cavity effusions also are common clinical findings in dogs with < 5% of normal factor VIII activity. Animals with 5–10% of normal activity often do not bleed spontaneously but exhibit prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery. Affected cats and sometimes small dogs can show prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma; however, rarely do they bleed spontaneously, probably because of their agility and light weight.  Affected animals usually have very low concentrations of factor VIII (< 10%) and prolonged ACT and aPTT. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations are greater than or equal to normal. Carrier animals have intermediate concentrations of factor VIII (40–60%), and results of coagulation screening tests are usually normal. Care should be taken in diagnosis if animals are < 6 months old, because of possible low production of coagulation factors by an immature liver. Usually, results of coagulation screening tests are normal in carrier animals.  Treatment of bleeding diatheses requires repeated transfusions of cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, every 8–12 hours) until bleeding has been controlled. Unless the patient has clinical signs of anemia, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate is preferable to whole blood because of possible sensitization to RBC antigens with repeated transfusions.  Factor IX Deficiency (Hemophilia B) Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B) is diagnosed less often than factor VIII deficiency. It has been reported in several breeds of purebred dogs, a mixed-breed dog, a family of Siamese-cross cats, and a family of British Shorthair cats. The defect is X-linked with carrier females and affected males; however, affected females can occur in closely inbred families.  Clinical signs of factor IX deficiency are similar to those of factor VIII deficiency. Some animals show no signs until trauma or surgery. The ACT and aPTT are prolonged. Carrier animals with 40–60% of normal factor IX activity are usually subclinically affected, and results of coagulation screening tests are normal.  Treatment of factor IX deficiency requires transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, every 12 hours) until bleeding resolves. Often, hemorrhage into the abdomen, thorax, or CNS, or between muscle fascial planes, occurs and can be undetected until a crisis.  Factor X Deficiency Factor X deficiency has been reported in a single family of American Cocker Spaniels; the inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance (1).Factor X deficiency has also been reported in a Chihuahua and a Jack Russell Terrier (2, 3).  Homozygotes usually die early in life or are stillborn because of massive internal hemorrhage. Heterozygotes have mild to severe bleeding problems.  ACT, aPTT, and PT are usually prolonged when animals have < 30% normal factor X activity.  Transfusions with fresh or fresh frozen plasma are required to control hemorrhage.  Factor XI Deficiency Factor XI deficiency has been recognized in Kerry Blue Terriers, a female English Springer Spaniel, a Great Pyrenees dog, Weimaraners, and Holstein cattle.  Inheritance is autosomal; however, whether the gene is dominant or recessive is not known. A single case involving an adult cat that had epistaxis and systemic lupus erythematosus was attributed to a circulating inhibitor of factor XI.  Mild deficiencies usually go undetected. In severe deficiencies with factor XI at 30–40% or less of normal activity, mild prolonged bleeding can occur after trauma or surgery.  Bleeding tendencies in patients with factor XI deficiency usually are not immediate, but delayed 3–4 days. ACT and aPTT are usually prolonged.  Transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, IV, once) is sufficient to stop bleeding for up to 3 days.  Factor XII (Hageman Factor) Deficiency In dogs, factor XII (Hageman factor) deficiency has been reported in German Shorthaired Pointers, Standard Poodles, and a family of Miniature Poodles; in cats it is also commonly reported. Affected animals do not have clinical bleeding problems. This deficiency is usually diagnosed coincidentally when coagulation screening tests show prolonged aPTT.  Humans with factor XII deficiency do not have bleeding problems; however, they do show a predisposition to thrombosis or infections, which is attributed to the normal role of factor XII in fibrinolysis and complement activation. Tendencies for thrombosis or infection have not been reported in animals.  Factor XII deficiency has been found to coexist with von Willebrand disease in dogs and with factor IX deficiency in cats. In affected animals, bleeding tendencies are not exacerbated (4, 5).  Factor XII is not present in the plasma of birds, marine mammals, and reptiles, without untoward effects.  Deficiency of Factors II, VII, IX, and X Deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X has been described in Devon Rex cats that experienced bleeding, most commonly after surgery. Bleeding can be controlled by vitamin K administration, and some of these cats appear to overcome this bleeding tendency as adults.  Prekallikrein Deficiency Prekallikrein deficiency has been reported in Poodles, a family of miniature horses, and a family of Belgian horses. Clinical bleeding problems are not usually apparent; however, excessive bleeding after castration was reported in one horse (6). The diagnosis is usually made coincidentally when coagulation screening tests are performed. ACT and aPTT are usually prolonged.  Poor Clot Strength Poor clot strength in Greyhounds has been found to cause delayed postoperative bleeding.Viscoelastic testing studies comparing Greyhound and non-Greyhound dogs have shown that Greyhounds have longer times to initial and maximal clot formation, lower maximal amplitude (7, 8), and faster clot breakdown (8). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is effective at preventing or stopping bleeding in affected dogs (9).  Acquired Coagulation Protein Disorders in Animals Liver Disease Most coagulation proteins are produced primarily in the liver. Therefore, liver disease characterized by necrosis, inflammation, neoplasia, or cirrhosis often is associated with decreased production of coagulation proteins, anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic proteins. Because the various coagulation proteins have a relatively short half-life (4 hours–2 days), mild to marked deficiencies secondary to severe hepatopathies can result.  aPTT and/or PT is prolonged in 50–75% of dogs with severe liver disease (10), meaning that the factor activity is < 30% of normal. Because of the wide-reaching impact of liver disease on many aspects of hemostasis, it is difficult to predict bleeding tendencies in affected dogs. Coagulation tests are often performed before liver biopsy.  Severe hepatic diseases can also lead to DIC. Activities of fibrinogen (an acute phase reactant) and vWF (which is produced extrahepatically) may be increased in some individuals with liver disease.  Vitamin K Deficiency Vitamin K is solubilized in mixed micelles before its passive diffusion across the brush border of the intestines. Fat malabsorption associated with inadequate amounts of bile salts (as with biliary obstruction), lymphangiectasia, or severe villous atrophy can result in vitamin deficiency and coagulopathy because the functional vitamin K−dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X cannot undergo carboxylation necessary for their activation.  Ingestion of Anticoagulant Rodenticides Ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticides causes a coagulopathy because functional vitamin K−dependent factors cannot undergo carboxylation necessary for their activation. Inactive precursor coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X are still produced by the liver; however, gamma-carboxylation of the inactive precursors does not occur, because the rodenticide inhibits the epoxide reductase enzyme required for recycling active vitamin K.  Anticoagulant rodenticide ingredients are classified by generation, with first-generation and intermediate-generation poisons necessitating multiple feedings to kill the target species. Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides are more potent and kill in a single feeding.  First-generation anticoagulant rodenticides include the coumarin class (containing ingredients like warfarin, pindone, coumafuryl, and coumachlor) and the indanedione class (containing ingredients like chlorophacinone and diphacinone). These two classes are derived from different chemical structures.  Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides include brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone.  The half-lives of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides are much longer; they depress clotting factors for 2–4 weeks, compared to the 7–10 days of depression produced by first- and intermediate-generation anticoagulant rodenticides.  Animals that ingest anticoagulant rodenticides can develop bruising or hematomas over pressure points or in the nasopharynx after minor trauma from ingested hard or sharp particles. Bleeding into body cavities can occur, resulting in acute collapse. Often, affected animals do not bleed within the first 24 hours after ingesting the toxin. aPTT, PT, and ACT are usually prolonged.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Factor VII has the shortest half-life of the vitamin K−dependent coagulation proteins; therefore, prothrombin time is often abnormal before other tests and can be used to monitor response to treatment.  Factor VII has the shortest half-life of the vitamin K−dependent coagulation proteins; therefore, PT is often abnormal before other tests and can be used to monitor response to treatment.  In cases of acute ingestion, emetics, absorbents, and cathartics are administered to minimize absorption. Vitamin K therapy is often initiated in animals exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides even if they do not show clinical signs.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Vitamin K therapy is often initiated in animals exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides even if they do not show clinical signs of poisoning.  The recommended treatment for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning is to administer phytonadione (vitamin K1) at an initial dosage of 2.5–3 mg/kg, SC, once, followed by 1.25–2.5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours for 14–28 days. PT should be measured 48 hours after completion of the initial course, and if it has not yet normalized, treatment should be continued for another week (followed by measurement of PT again 48 hours later).  Intoxication with long-acting, second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides is more common, so shorter treatment durations should be considered only if the animal is known to have ingested a short-acting, first-generation anticoagulant rodenticide. IV administration of vitamin K1 is not recommended, because anaphylactic reactions can result. Administration of vitamin K3 is not useful. Treatment protocols are similar for most domestic species.  In addition to instituting vitamin K therapy, clinically affected (eg, bleeding) animals could require treatment with blood products. The vitamin K–dependent clotting factors can be transfused via frozen, fresh frozen, or fresh plasma. RBCs can be delivered to clinically anemic patients as packed RBCs. Finally, clotting factors combined with RBCs can be delivered in fresh or stored whole blood.  Ingestion of Moldy Sweet Clover Dicumarol formation in moldy sweet clover antagonizes vitamin K as described above for anticoagulant rodenticides. Ingestion can cause hemorrhage. Cattle are most commonly affected; horses, sheep, pigs, and other species can also be affected (see Sweet Clover Poisoning). Treatment is similar to that for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning, but the duration is short: phytonadione (vitamin K1) administered at 1–1.5 mg/kg, SC, every 24 hours for 2–3 days.  Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation DIC is not a primary disease; rather it is a syndrome that occurs secondary to numerous underlying diseases, such as bacterial, viral, rickettsial, protozoal, or parasitic diseases; heat stroke; burns; neoplasia; or severe trauma. Commonly, the underlying disease causes sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an uncontrolled mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory state characterized by massive activation and consumption of coagulation proteins, endogenous inhibitors, fibrinolytic proteins, and platelets.  In the initial stage of DIC, the animal is hypercoagulable because of circulating inflammatory mediators that activate hemostasis via increased exposure of TF and inhibitor consumption. With time, consumption of coagulation factors can lead to a hypocoagulable state with overt bleeding.  Because of the progressive nature of DIC, clinical findings vary considerably and range from no overt signs of disease, accompanied by subtle, if any, changes in routine hemostasis parameters (aPTT, PT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count), to clinical signs of organ failure associated with microvascular thrombosis in vital organs, finally culminating in overt bleeding. The latter has historically been considered the typical DIC case, in which there are also pronounced alterations in hemostasis parameters and a drop in platelet count.  Viscoelastic testing can differentiate the DIC stage in dogs. Dogs in the hypercoagulable stage have a much better chance of survival than do dogs in the hypocoagulable stage. This higher chance of survival is likely because of early and aggressive intervention through supportive and/or antithrombotic therapy while the underlying disease is treated. Aggressive treatment likely minimizes thromboembolic complications and delays or even prevents progression to overt signs.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Viscoelastic testing can differentiate the DIC stage in dogs. Dogs in the hypercoagulable stage have a much better chance of survival than do dogs in the hypocoagulable stage.  In veterinary medicine, laboratory diagnosis of DIC is not standardized, and hemostatic function test results are not consistent; however, diagnosis of DIC is often based on the presence of three or more abnormal hemostatic parameters, such as aPTT, PT, fibrinogen concentration, D-dimer concentration, platelet count, and RBC morphology, along with a predisposing underlying disease. The increasing availability of viscoelastic testing has made definitive diagnosis of DIC possible. Postmortem fibrinolysis makes necropsy an insensitive diagnostic criterion.  Treatment of DIC must be directed first at diagnosing and treating the underlying disease. In addition, if the patient is hypercoagulable, heparin is indicated. If hypocoagulability and bleeding are present, heparin is no longer indicated; instead, fresh frozen plasma should be administered. Supportive care with fluids and possibly plasma expanders helps to maintain effective circulating volume.  Key Points Animals with clotting factor abnormalities are likely to develop hematomas or bleed into body cavities or joints.  Important inherited factor abnormalities often become evident at teething or after surgery.  Treatment of anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis can require 4–6 weeks of treatment with vitamin K1.  DIC is always secondary to another condition, and treatment must address the underlying disorder as well as the coagulopathy.

Abnormal clot formation can lead to thrombosis, clot extension, and thromboembolism.  Clinically, abnormal clot formation can go unnoticed; however, thromboembolic disease of substantial size or major sites (eg, brain, lungs, aorta) can cause profound clinical signs, organ damage, and death. Thromboembolic disease complicates many common diseases in veterinary medicine.  Congenital Anticoagulant Disorders in Animals Congenital deficiency of any anticoagulant protein has not been recognized in domestic animals. If such a condition exists in animals, it is probably incompatible with life.  Acquired Procoagulant Disorders in Animals The presence of hypercoagulability is difficult to assess clinically in dogs and cats.  The importance of hypercoagulability and thromboembolic disease was not well defined in veterinary medicine until the advent of viscoelastic testing, which enables global assessment of hemostatic function in whole blood. Advantages of viscoelastic testing include evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of developing blood clots (including clot formation, kinetics, strength, stability, and resolution) and immediate detection of hyper- and hypocoagulable states.  Certain diseases in animals have been associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Cats with cardiomyopathy, especially those with an enlarged left atrium, can develop large thromboemboli in the aorta or brachial artery. Heartworm disease can also be associated with thrombosis in cats. Thrombosis has been reported in dogs with protein-losing nephropathies, hyperadrenocorticism, protein-losing enteropathy, neoplasia, heat stroke, sepsis, heartworm disease, and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Dogs with pancreatitis have been found to have evidence of hypercoagulability, and in some dogs the presence of multiple comorbid processes listed here increases the risk of thrombosis. Thrombi and thromboemboli have been reported in horses with systemic inflammatory diseases (eg, colic, laminitis, or equine ehrlichial colitis) and in instances of prolonged jugular catheter placement and infusion of drugs that irritate the vasculature.  Neoplasia is also a risk factor for hypercoagulability and likely associated complications, such as thromboembolic disease. Many cells and proteins involved in maintaining hemostasis are also involved in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Deep vein thrombosis is an important clinical complication in human cancer patients; however, whether the same is true in dogs with cancer is unknown.  In protein-losing nephropathies (eg, glomerulopathies, nephrotic syndrome, renal amyloidosis), a deficiency of antithrombin has been well documented. With a molecular weight of 57,000 kilodaltons (kD), antithrombin is similar in size to albumin (60,000 kD); therefore, glomerular lesions sufficient to result in albumin loss also result in antithrombin loss. Other abnormalities identified in renal disease include increased responsiveness of platelets to agonists, increased procoagulant activities, and decreased antiplasmin activity.  Hypercholesterolemia has been associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. It is hypothesized that endothelial and platelet membrane phospholipid concentrations are altered, leading to damaged vasculature and increased platelet responsiveness to agonists, respectively. Increased production of thromboxane via the cyclooxygenase pathway in platelets has been observed. Diseases characterized by hypercholesterolemia include hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and pancreatitis. All have been associated with increased risk of thrombus formation, often pulmonary thrombosis.  In cats with cardiomyopathy, endomyocardial lesions and turbulent blood flow through the heart chambers and valves secondary to altered myocardial functioning are thought to initiate thrombus formation. Specific deficiencies of anticoagulant or fibrinolytic proteins have not been reported. Although antithrombin is markedly increased in these cats, it does not provide protective benefits. Cats with cardiac disease secondary to hyperthyroidism are often treated not only with drugs to alter thyroid function, but also with drugs (eg, propranolol, atenolol, or diltiazem) that abate clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction.  Horses that have colic associated with endotoxemia have decreased plasminogen activity and protein C antigen concentration. Their mortality rate and risk of thrombus formation are increased. Laminitis is thought to be the end result of several diverse systemic disorders. Microthrombi in the vasculature of the hoof lamina have been identified in the early stages of laminitis. One theory is that endotoxin has direct effects on the vasculature and activates contact factors in the coagulation cascade. Ischemia of the lamina secondary to edema, vascular compression, and possible blood shunting at the level of the coronet also damage endothelium. When circulation is reestablished, reperfusion injury results, and the exposed subendothelial collagen promotes thrombosis.  Thromboprophylaxis (clot prevention) is standard treatment in some diseases of small animals, including protein-losing nephropathy and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (1). In addition, clot prevention may be considered in small animals with multiple hypercoagulable diseases.  In an animal with thrombi or thromboemboli, it is imperative to diagnose and manage any underlying disease processes, and to provide good supportive care, including pain management.Maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion is critical.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Diagnosis and management of underlying diseases and provision of supportive care, including pain management, is imperative in animals with thrombi or thromboemboli.  Dissolution of clots and prevention of clot extension by administration of anticoagulants (eg, heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors) and antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) has had mixed success, in part because of a lack of evidence regarding effective dosing of these drugs for clot prevention.  Unfractionated heparin is most commonly used as initial treatment. Low-molecular-weight heparins have been evaluated in cats with aortic thromboembolism; however, the cost is appreciably higher, and no clear benefit has been shown when compared with unfractionated heparin.  Heparin facilitates the action of antithrombin, but to be effective, adequate antithrombin must be present. In dogs with protein-losing nephropathies or in horses with endotoxemia, plasma transfusion could be necessary before heparin therapy is effective. For clot prevention in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, individually adjusting heparin doses according to anti-Xa activity has been found to improve outcomes, compared with nonindividualized (standardized) dosing (2).  Drugs that inhibit factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban and apixaban) can be administered orally and do not require frequent monitoring. Their use is being studied in dogs and cats; however, expense is an issue. Currently, the only treatment shown to increase survival time after the initial thrombotic event in cats is clopidogrel (18.75 mg/cat, PO, every 24 hours longterm), which inhibits platelet function.  Use of fibrinolytic compounds to enhance dissolution of clots has shown promise in animals.  Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), also known as alteplase, has more fibrin specificity than does streptokinase or urokinase and, therefore, provides more localized fibrinolytic effects. The main deterrent to the use of TPA is its high cost. A study of cats with aortic thrombosis that were treated with TPA found a risk for reperfusion injury and hyperkalemia after the clot dissolved (3).  Streptokinase is more available and less expensive; however, the therapeutic dose is difficult to determine. In addition, many animals have naturally occurring antibodies to streptokinase as a result of previous streptococcal infections.  Key Points Many of the underlying diseases that cause DIC can also cause localized thromboembolism.  Aortic thromboembolism in cats with cardiomyopathy has a guarded prognosis, as well as risk of recurrence.  Thromboprophylaxis (clot prevention) is recommended for a number of diseases in small animals including protein-losing nephropathy and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.\n","Successfully saved 'circulatory_system' to Google Drive\n","add another file? (y/n): y\n","Enter the filenamecirculatory_system.txt\n","Paste textA representative number of herd samples should be collected from a minimum of 10 animals to account for the typical high individual variation in the number of eggs shed. Samples can be combined after thorough mixing to enable examination of a single composite sample for the herd.  Refrigeration is important for sample integrity; unless refrigerated, helminth eggs can develop and hatch in samples collected in the morning and not returned to the laboratory until the end of the day.  The same qualitative fecal examination methods described above for small animals are used in horses and production animals.  Quantitative fecal egg count (FEC) methods are also used in large animal practice. FECs are a necessary tool for the early detection of anthelmintic resistance, and they are the cornerstone upon which selective programs in equine parasite control are based.  The Cornell-Wisconsin (double-centrifugation)and McMaster methods are available for obtaining FECs in production animals. The mini-FLOTAC device is a newer apparatus for fecal egg detection that is now commercially available in the US.  The Cornell-Wisconsin double-centrifugation technique is the most sensitive FEC method and should be used only when relatively low counts are expected (as with adult cattle or camelids). At counts of > 100 eggs per gram (EPG), counting fatigue negatively affects FEC accuracy. In such situations, more accurate counts will be achieved using a dilution method such as the McMaster count.  The mini-FLOTAC procedure is more sensitive than the McMaster method; however, it is also more time-consuming.  In ruminants, these FEC methods can be used to estimate relative infection burden for nematodes of the “GI parasite complex” (eg, trichostrongylid eggs of cattle), while also detecting coccidia and other parasites, such as tapeworms. In horses, FECs are used mainly to quantify fecal shedding of strongylid eggs.  The Cornell-Wisconsin method consists of the following steps:  Three grams of fecal matter is placed in a container, suspended in approximately 15 mL of water, strained through a gauze square into a 15-mL tube, and centrifuged (270 g, 10 minutes).  The supernatant is poured off, and the sediment is mixed with saturated sugar solution, filling the tube enough to form a positive meniscus before a 22 × 22-mm coverslip is placed on the lip of the test tube.  The tube is centrifuged again at low speed (270 g, 5 minutes).  The coverslip, with the surface film containing eggs, is removed and transferred to a microscope slide to count trichostrongylid eggs in cattle, sheep, goat, or camelid feces.  The total is divided by 3 to derive the EPG.  Other parasites are noted, if present, and assigned a general abundance designation of +1 (few), +2 (small number), +3 (large number), or +4 (too numerous to count).  When FECs are likely to be high (> 100 EPG), the McMaster or mini-FLOTAC method is recommended. Both methods use a calibrated slide or chamber and sugar flotation medium. A saturated solution of table salt (specific gravity 1.20) is an inexpensive alternative medium for diagnosing production animal parasites; however, salt can be highly corrosive to metal surfaces. Magnesium sulfate (specific gravity 1.20) is the preferred medium for swine feces.  McMaster slides contain two chambers with etched areas of known volume (see McMaster slide image) that are used to estimate the EPG and are frequently used for FECs in horses and small ruminants. The McMaster method proceeds as follows:  Fecal matter (4 g) mixed with sugar flotation medium (56 mL) is strained (through cheesecloth or tea strainer).  After thorough mixing, the solution is introduced into each chamber with a Pasteur pipette.  The eggs within the marked grid are counted under low-power magnification (10X objective).  McMaster egg-counting slide   Image Courtesy of Dr. Gary Conboy.  Each chamber of the McMaster slide has a volume of 0.15 mL under the etched grid. Because two chambers are examined, 0.3 mL is evaluated from the total sample volume of 60 mL (ie, the total sample is 200 times greater than the portion examined). For example, if 4 g of fecal matter is mixed with 56 mL of sugar solution, then each egg counted is multiplied by 50 (ie, the factor of 200 noted above, divided by 4 g of feces in the original sample) to yield the EPG in the fecal sample (ie, the sensitivity is 50 EPG). In horses, the sensitivity can be increased to 25 EPG by using 4 g of feces in half the volume (26 mL) of sugar solution; the total number of eggs counted on the slide (in chambers 1 and 2) is still multiplied by 50 to yield the EPG.  Acceptable correlation between the EPG and the relative worm burden is often possible in young animals; adult animals, however, typically have low (< 5 EPG) or zero counts.  In young cattle, which generally have EPG counts 10 times higher than those of adult animals, EPG counts > 50 reflect a moderate infection, and EPG counts > 500 indicate a heavy burden and a need for treatment. There is no consensus on the exact number; however, treatment thresholds of ≥ 250 EPG are often used for strongyle control programs in horses. For sheep and goats, an EPG count > 5,000 is considered high and warrants treatment.  Because fluke eggs do not float readily, quantitative fecal sedimentation procedures are usually used:  Two grams of fecal matter is mixed with 35 mL of soapy solution (2% liquid detergent) and strained through gauze into a 50-mL centrifuge tube.  The tube is filled with soapy water and allowed to stand for 3 minutes, after which half of the supernatant is discarded.  This procedure is repeated two or three times, until the supernatant is clean.  All but 15 mL is poured off, and two drops of new methylene blue are added.  The eggs are counted with a dissecting microscope in a gridded Petri dish or by examining several coverslipped microscope slides of the new methylene blue mixture.  The eggs of the liver fluke Fasciola hepatica can be differentiated from those of Paramphistomum rumen flukes by their golden color, more distinct barrel shape, and slightly greater size, compared with the gray color, more pointy end, and lesser size of the usually nonpathogenic rumen fluke eggs. Commercial sieve-sediment kits can decrease sample preparation time by 50%.  In cattle, Fasciola EPG counts of > 3 suggest economic losses, and an EPG count of > 10 might be associated with clinical signs. Overview of Hematopoietic System in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (0) Videos (0) The hematopoietic system is the organ system comprising the blood and tissues responsible for blood cell generation through the process of hematopoiesis (see figure illustrating normal hematopoiesis).  Normal hematopoiesis   Image Courtesy of Teton NewMedia.  The cellular elements of blood deliver oxygen to cells (RBCs), protect against foreign organisms and antigens (WBCs), and initiate coagulation (platelets), whereas the noncellular component of blood (plasma) supplies cells with water, electrolytes, nutrients, and hormones and removes waste products.  Because of the hematopoietic system's diversity, its diseases are best discussed from a functional perspective. Functions can be classified as either appropriate responses to abnormal situations (eg, leukocytosis and left shift in response to inflammation) or primary abnormalities of the hematopoietic system (eg, pancytopenia from bone marrow dysfunction). Furthermore, abnormalities can be quantitative (ie, too many or too few cells) or qualitative (ie, abnormalities in function). (Also see The Biology of the Immune System.) Red Blood Cells in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Key Points | For More Information Erythrocytes (RBCs) are largely produced from hematopoietic stem cells in bone marrow.  In most mammals, mature RBCs have a biconcave disk shape and lack a nucleus. Nucleated red blood cells (nRBCs), or erythroblasts, are immature RBCs that have not undergone nuclear extrusion and still contain a nucleus. Camelid RBCs are elliptical. Mature RBCs in birds are large oval cells containing oval nuclei.  The function of RBCs is to carry oxygen to tissues at pressures sufficient to permit its rapid diffusion. This process requires the following biological elements:  a carrier molecule (hemoglobin)  a vehicle (RBCs) capable of bringing intact hemoglobin (Hgb) to cells  a metabolism geared to protect both RBCs and Hgb from damage  Interference with synthesis or release of Hgb, production or survival of RBCs, or metabolism can cause disease.  Hgb is a complex molecule, formed of 4 heme units attached to 4 globins (2 alpha and 2 beta globins). Iron is added in the last step of erythropoiesis by the ferrochelatase enzyme.  Interference with normal production of heme or globin (such as with lead poisoning or deficiency of copper or iron) leads to anemia.  Hemoglobinopathies such as thalassemia and sickle cell disease, important genetic diseases of humans, have not been observed in other animals. In these diseases, production of globins (alpha, beta, or both) does not balance heme production, and Hgb is not functional.  The only known naturally occurring hemoglobinopathy of animals is porphyria. Although described in several species, porphyria is most important as a cause of photosensitivity in cattle.  RBC mass, and thus oxygen-carrying capacity, remains constant over time in healthy animals. A decreased RBC mass (anemia) can be caused by blood loss, excess destruction of RBCs (hemolysis), or decreased production of RBCs.  Once produced in bone marrow, mature RBCs have a finite lifespan in circulation before senescent RBCs are destroyed. RBC production and destruction must be carefully balanced to avoid both anemia and erythrocytosis (excess RBCs in circulation).  Erythropoiesis (RBC production) is regulated by erythropoietin, a hormone that increases in the presence of hypoxia. Erythropoietin acts on bone marrow in concert with other humoral mediators to increase the number of stem cells entering RBC production, shorten maturation time, and cause early release of reticulocytes (immature RBCs).  In most species, the kidney is both the sensor organ and the major site of erythropoietin production. Chronic kidney disease can be associated with anemia in later stages, as the kidneys fail to produce this vital hormone in sufficient amounts.  Nutrient deficiency (eg, of iron, folate, or vitamin B12) can also suppress erythropoiesis, as can chronic debilitating diseases, inflammatory diseases, and endocrine disorders (such as hypothyroidism, hypoadrenocorticism, or hyperestrogenism).  Toxic insult, infectious diseases (eg, feline leukemia virus disease, histoplasmosis), and neoplasms within bone marrow (eg, myelofibrosis) can all primarily affect the bone marrow, leading to decreased erythropoiesis with or without other cytopenias. Each of the conditions mentioned here would be expected to cause nonregenerative anemia.  To balance RBC production, two mechanisms exist for removal of senescent RBCs: intravascular and extravascular hemolysis. Both conserve the principal constituents of the cell for reuse.  Removal of aged RBCs normally occurs by phagocytosis by fixed macrophages in the spleen. As RBCs age, they change antigenically, acquiring senescent antigens and losing flexibility because of impaired ATP production. Both of these changes increase the chance that the cells will become trapped in the spleen and removed by macrophages.  After phagocytosis and subsequent disruption of the cell membrane, Hgb is converted to heme and globin. Iron is released from the heme moiety and either stored in the macrophage as ferritin or hemosiderin or released into the circulation for transport back to the marrow. The remaining heme is converted to bilirubin, which is released by macrophages into the systemic circulation, where it complexes with albumin for transport to hepatocytes. In the liver, it is conjugated and excreted into the bile.  This normal process of extravascular hemolysis of aged RBCs occurs at a low rate every day, thereby accounting for the low bilirubin concentrations measurable in blood in healthy animals. In diseases causing excess extravascular hemolysis, RBCs may be destroyed before they are senescent, resulting in a shortened RBC lifespan, anemia, and hyperbilirubinemia.  In animals in good health, approximately 1% of aging RBCs are hemolyzed within circulation (intravascular hemolysis) instead of within the spleen. In this process, free Hgb is released and quickly converted to Hgb dimers that bind to haptoglobin and are transported to the liver. There, they are metabolized in the same manner as products from RBCs removed by phagocytosis.  In diseases causing excess intravascular hemolysis, increased numbers of RBCs are destroyed in the circulation, releasing hemoglobin at a rate that exceeds haptoglobin's binding capacity. This process results in excess hemoglobinemia, which may be detectable as hemolyzed-looking serum. Excess Hgb and, therefore, iron are excreted in the urine (hemoglobinuria).  The principal metabolic pathway of RBCs is glycolysis, and the main energy source for this in most species is glucose. Glucose enters RBCs by an insulin-independent mechanism, and most is metabolized to produce ATP and reduced nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NADH). The energy of ATP is used to fuel RBC membrane pumps that work to preserve cell shape and flexibility.  The reducing potential of NADH is utilized via the methemoglobin reductase pathway to maintain iron in Hgb in its reduced form (Fe2+). Glucose not used in glycolysis is metabolized via a second pathway, the hexose monophosphate (HMP) shunt, which does not produce energy but is important for maintaining the sulfhydryl groups of globin in their reduced state.  These metabolic pathways are key for the survival and functionality of RBCs as they circulate. Some anemic disorders are the direct result of abnormal RBC metabolism and interference with glycolysis.  Inherited deficiency of pyruvate kinase, a key glycolytic enzyme, causes ATP deficiency, which leads to decreased RBC lifespan and hemolytic anemia.  Excessive oxidant stress can overload the protective HMP shunt or methemoglobin reductase pathways, causing Heinz body hemolysis or methemoglobin formation, respectively. Hemolytic anemia caused by acetaminophen toxicity in cats is an example.  While anemia can be caused by RBC loss (bleeding or excess hemolysis) or lack of production, absolute erythrocytosis, by contrast, is generally the result of excess RBC production rather than failure to clear senescent RBCs.  Erythrocytosis can be a primary problem of the bone marrow (polycythemia vera) or a secondary problem, resulting from dysfunction outside of the bone marrow.  When secondary, erythrocytosis may be an appropriate, compensatory response to try to increase oxygen-carrying capacity in chronic hypoxic states (eg, pulmonary disease, right-to-left intracardiac shunts), or it may be an inappropriate response, as is the case with erythropoietin-producing neoplasms.  Relative erythrocytosis is the term used to describe increased RBC mass relative to plasma, which most commonly results from dehydration (hemoconcentration) or splenic contraction.  Key Points RBC production is regulated by the hormone erythropoietin, which is released as needed by the kidneys.  Senescent RBCs are removed primarily by macrophages in the spleen.  Anemia is caused by blood loss, excess hemolysis, or decreased production of RBCs. White Blood Cells in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Phagocytes | Lymphocytes | Key Points | For More Information Major types of circulating WBCs, or leukocytes, include neutrophils, eosinophils, basophils, lymphocytes, and monocytes. These WBC types can be further classified according to specific characteristics.  Granulocytes are characterized by the presence of cytoplasmic granules (specialized secretory vesicles containing various cytotoxic molecules, enzymes, and peptides). Neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils are granulocytes that have lobulated nuclei and are classified according to the staining characteristics of their cytoplasmic granules as neutral (neutrophils), red or pink (eosinophils), or lavender or purple (basophils). Mast cells are another type of granulocytic leukocyte that has a round, rather than lobulated, purple nucleus.  Some veterinary species (eg, rabbits and guinea pigs) have a WBC type called heterophils. Heterophils are analogous to neutrophils in other species but have eosinophilic cytoplasmic granules. Cytologically, they can be difficult to distinguish from eosinophils. The cellular equivalents to neutrophils in birds and reptiles are also called heterophils and have eosinophilic granules.  Phagocytes are characterized by participation in phagocytosis, the process of engulfing and destroying particles such as invading microorganisms or debris. Neutrophils, macrophages, and dendritic cells are considered professional phagocytes, while other types of cells may participate in phagocytosis to a lesser extent.  Cells can also be classified according to the shape of their nucleus. Mature neutrophils, as well as eosinophils and basophils, have a segmented nucleus and thus are known as polymorphonuclear cells. This is in contrast to mononuclear phagocytes (monocytes and macrophages) as well as lymphocytes, which prototypically have a round nucleus. However, monocytes can sometimes have a pseudolobulated nucleus, resembling that of a neutrophil.  Band neutrophils are a type of immature neutrophil distinguished from mature neutrophils by a lack of clear segmentation in the shape of the nucleus. Other neutrophil precursors include myelocytes and metamyelocytes, which are classified by their stage of maturation.  Reptiles have a type of mononuclear cell, thought to be a monocyte variant, called an azurophil. Birds, in contrast, lack azurophils.   Mononuclear phagocytes arise primarily from bone marrow and are released into blood as monocytes. They can circulate for up to a few days before entering tissues and differentiating into macrophages.  Neutrophils circulate for only a few hours before traveling to tissues. (See also Physiology of Leukocytes in Animals.)  Phagocytes in Animals The principal function of phagocytes is to defend against invading microorganisms by ingesting and destroying them, thus contributing to cellular inflammatory responses.  The process of phagocytosis can be divided into five distinct stages:  Attraction of phagocytes (chemotaxis) to microorganisms, antigen-antibody complexes, and other inflammatory mediators  Attachment to the organism  Ingestion  Fusion of cell lysosomes with ingested microorganisms and bacterial killing  Digestion  In addition, many phagocytes have other specialized functions.  Functions of the immune system can be divided broadly into the innate immune system, which is rapid but nonspecific, and the adaptive immune system, which is slower but more specific toward specific pathogenic stimuli. The adaptive immune system can be further divided into cellular and humoral components. There is substantial cross-talk among these functional units of the immune system.  Monocytes form a link to the adaptive immune system by processing antigen for presentation to lymphocytes and by producing substances such as IL-1, which initiates fever and lymphocyte activation and stimulates the development of early hematopoietic progenitors.  Eosinophils, while having a role as phagocytes, also have more specific functions that include defending against metazoan parasites and modulating the inflammatory process. They respond chemotactically to histamine, immune complexes, and eosinophil chemotactic factor of anaphylaxis, a substance released by degranulating mast cells.  Basophils are not true phagocytes but contain large amounts of histamine and other inflammatory mediators.  Eosinophilia and basophilia may occur in response to systemic allergic reactions and to tissue invasion by parasites.  As with RBCs, production and circulating numbers of phagocytes are tightly regulated and controlled by various humoral factors, including colony-stimulating factors and interleukins.  Unlike RBCs, which remain circulating in blood, phagocytes use this compartment as a pathway to tissues. Consequently, the number of phagocytes in blood reflects circumstances in the tissues (eg, inflammation) as well as the proliferative function of bone marrow. The sensitivity with which phagocytes respond to these conditions varies from species to species.  While neutrophilia is most commonly expected with tissue inflammation and infection, neutropenia can occur with overwhelming tissue demand, and some cases of neutropenia in dogs may be immune mediated. Regardless of the cause, severe neutropenia is likely to result in bacterial infection.  Finally, phagocyte precursors may undergo malignant transformation, which results in acute or chronic myelogenous leukemia.  Lymphocytes in Animals Lymphocytes are responsible for both humoral and cellular immunity. Cells of these two branches of the immune system cannot be differentiated morphologically; however, they differ in their dynamics of production and circulation.  Lymphocyte production in mammals originates in bone marrow. Some lymphocytes destined to be involved in cellular immunity migrate to the thymus and differentiate further under the influence of thymic hormones. These become T cells and are responsible for a variety of helper or cytotoxic immunological functions. Most circulating lymphocytes are T cells, but T cells are also present in spleen and lymph nodes.  B cells, on the other hand, migrate directly to organs without undergoing modification in the thymus and are responsible for humoral immunity (antibody production). (See also Physiology of Leukocytes in Animals.)  Thus, lymphoid organs have populations of both B and T lymphocytes. In lymph nodes, follicular centers are primarily comprised of B cells, while parafollicular zones are primarily comprised of T cells. In the spleen, most lymphocytes of the red pulp are B cells, whereas those of the periarteriolar lymphoid sheaths are T cells. Close association of T cells and B cells within lymphoid organs is essential to immune function.  Lymphocyte function in the cellular immune system features both afferent (receptor) and efferent (effector) components. Long-lived T cells of the peripheral blood are receptors. In response to antigens to which they have been previously sensitized, they leave the circulation and undergo blast transformation to form activated T cells, which in turn cause other T cells to undergo blast transformation, both locally and systemically. Stimulated T cells produce lymphokines with a wide range of activities, such as attraction and activation of neutrophils, macrophages, and lymphocytes.  The humoral immune system is composed of B cells that produce several classes of antibodies. When sensitized B cells encounter antigen, they divide and differentiate into plasma cells that produce antibody. Therefore, each initially stimulated B cell produces a clone of plasma cells, all producing the same specific antibody.  Antibody molecules (immunoglobulins) fall into several classes, each with its own functional characteristics:  IgA is the principal antibody of respiratory and intestinal secretions.  IgM is the first antibody produced in response to a newly recognized antigen.  IgG is the principal antibody in circulating blood.  IgE is the principal antibody involved in allergic reactions.  Antibodies perform their functions by combining with specific antigens that stimulated their production. Antigen-antibody complexes can be chemotactic for phagocytes, or they can activate complement, a process that produces both cell lysis and substances chemotactic for neutrophils and macrophages. In this manner, the humoral immune system is related to, and interacts with, the innate immune system.  The humoral immune system is also related to both the innate immune system and the cellular immune system in other ways. Both helper (CD4) and cytotoxic (CD8)T-cell classes have been described:  Helper T cells recognize processed antigen and activate the humoral immune response.  Cytotoxic T cells, after sensitization by antigen, are effector cells, which are especially important in antiviral immunity.  Natural killer cells, a class of lymphocyte distinct from T cells and B cells, destroy foreign cells (eg, neoplastic cells), even without prior sensitization.  Antigen processing by macrophages precedes recognition of an antigen by lymphocytes. These complex processes are involved in routine surveillance against neoplastic cells and recognition of normal “self” cells.  Lymphocyte response in disease may be appropriate (activation of the immune system to defend against microorganisms) or inappropriate (immune-mediated disease and lymphoproliferative malignancies). (Also see The Biology of the Immune System.)  Immune-mediated disease results from the immune system's failure to recognize host tissues as normal self cells. For example, in immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, antibodies are produced against the host’s own RBCs.  Another inappropriate immune system response is allergy. In allergic individuals, IgE antibodies against allergens bind to the surface of basophils and mast cells. When exposure to an allergen occurs, antigen-antibody complexes form, and degranulation of mast cells and basophils releases vasoactive amines. Reaction to this can be mild (as in urticaria or atopy) or life-threatening (as in anaphylaxis).  Lymphocytosis occurs in some species, especially cats, as a response to epinephrine secretion; lymphocytosis, therefore, may be nonspecific in this species and be accompanied by stress and a wide array of illnesses. Atypical lymphocytes may be present in the blood in response to antigenic stimulation (eg, vaccination). Persistent lymphocytosis in cattle infected with bovine leukemia virus is a benign polyclonal increase in lymphocyte numbers.  Lymphoproliferative malignancies include lymphomas and acute lymphoblastic and chronic lymphocytic leukemias. Lymphopenia may occur most commonly in response to glucocorticoid secretion (stress, illness, hyperadrenocorticism) or exogenous corticosteroid medications. (See also Leukogram Abnormalities in Animals.)  Key Points Phagocytes include granulocytes (neutrophils, eosinophils, and basophils), which circulate briefly, enter tissues, and have a short lifespan, and monocytes, which can persist for a long time in tissues as macrophages.  T lymphocytes may be helper (CD4) T cells, which process antigens and interact with humoral antibody production, or cytotoxic (CD8) T cells, which act, when sensitized, against specific antigens.  B lymphocytes differentiate into plasma cells and produce antibodies.  Natural killer lymphocytes destroy foreign cells (eg, neoplastic cells or those of transplanted organs). Platelets in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jan 2025 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (3) Tables (0) Videos (0) Platelets form the initial hemostatic plug whenever hemorrhage occurs. They also are the source of phospholipid needed for the interaction of coagulation factors to form a fibrin clot. Hemostasis is therefore broadly divided into primary hemostasis, ending in the formation of a platelet plug; secondary hemostasis, ending in the formation of a fibrin clot; and tertiary hemostasis, or fibrinolysis, ending in resolution or lysis of the clot. (Also see Hemostatic Disorders in Animals.)  Platelets are produced in bone marrow from megakaryocytes, under the influence of the hormone thrombopoietin. Beginning with invagination of the megakaryocyte cell membrane, platelet production results from subsequent fragmentation of megakaryocytes into individual platelets. (See images of cat, horse, and cow platelets.)  In contrast, thrombocytes in birds (which do not have platelets) are small cells with a round nucleus.  Blood smear, platelets, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Blood smear, platelets, horse   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Blood smear, platelets, cow   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  When vessel walls are damaged, collagen and tissue factor are exposed. Circulating platelets adhere to the endothelium via von Willebrand factor, undergo a shape change, and release ADP. Local aggregation of more platelets is stimulated by ADP, resulting in the formation of a primary hemostatic plug—a platelet plug. Ultimately, local accumulation of fibrin and platelets is known as a fibrin clot, which is needed for effective hemostasis at injury sites.  Clot formation is a necessary protective mechanism to stop or prevent bleeding; however, conditions of inappropriate thrombosis (clot formation) can jeopardize health (see Thrombosis, Embolism, and Aneurysm in Animals).  Platelet disorders are either quantitative (thrombocytopenia or thrombocytosis) or qualitative (thrombocytopathy).  Thrombocytopenia is one of the most common bleeding disorders of animals. In general, platelet counts must fall to < 30,000 platelets/mcL before the risk of spontaneous hemorrhage increases, though hemorrhage from minor trauma (venipuncture, cystocentesis) can occur with platelet counts in the range of 30,000–50,000 platelets/mcL. Spontaneous bleeding from severe thrombocytopenia (or thrombopathia) most commonly manifests as mucosal site (eg, gingiva, GI tract, urinary bladder, nasal passages, or eyes) bleeding or bruising (eg, petechiae, ecchymoses).  Consumption, destruction, or sequestration of platelets causes thrombocytopenia associated with increased platelet production by the bone marrow:  Consumptive thrombocytopenia occurs with massive hemorrhage or with DIC, secondary to a variety of diseases.  Destruction occurs in immune-mediated thrombocytopenia, in which platelets become coated with antiplatelet antibodies and are removed from the circulation by the fixed phagocyte system.  Excessive sequestration of platelets by an enlarged spleen (hypersplenism) can occur in conditions such as myeloproliferative diseases.  Decreased production of platelets in the marrow can be caused by drugs, toxins, or primary marrow disorders such as aplasia, fibrosis, or hematopoietic malignancy. In primary marrow disorders, more than one hematopoietic cell line is often decreased, resulting in bicytopenia or pancytopenia.  Congenital macrothrombocytopenia is a hereditary disorder of platelet division during the maturation process. This disorder results in thrombocytopenia (decreased numbers of individual platelets) with preservation of overall platelet mass, as fewer, but larger, platelets are produced; pathological bleeding is uncommon with this disorder. Cavalier King Charles Spaniels are commonly affected, and a genetic test is available.  Platelet activation during blood collection can cause platelets to clump; hematology analyzers can then provide erroneously low platelet counts, especially in cats. Blood film analysis to assess for platelet clumps is important in determining whether low machine-generated platelet counts are accurate.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Due to clumping, hematology analyzers can provide falsely low platelet counts, especially in cats.  Thrombocytopathies comprise a poorly defined group of diseases in which platelet numbers are normal but their function is impaired. Von Willebrand disease is characterized by a deficiency or malfunction of von Willebrand factor, which decreases platelet adhesion to the endothelium and impairs platelet plug formation. While von Willebrand disease is a primary hemostatic disorder that results in bleeding, platelets themselves are normal. Other hereditary disorders of platelet function have been described but are relatively rare.  Certain infections (feline leukemia virus, ehrlichiosis) and diseases (chronic kidney disease, liver failure) can also impair platelet function, in addition to disrupting the hematopoietic and coagulation systems in other ways. Aspirin administration causes a platelet function defect through its irreversible inhibition of thromboxane (which is necessary for platelet aggregation). Clopidogrel also irreversibly inhibits platelet function by binding an ADP receptor subtype necessary for platelet aggregation.  Thrombocytosis (increased platelet number) may be associated with primary marrow disease, such as in megakaryocytic leukemia (rare), chronic blood loss and iron deficiency, or chronic excess corticosteroid exposure (hyperadrenocorticism or exogenous corticosteroid medication).  Key Points Platelets are produced from megakaryocytes and form the first stage of coagulation (the hemostatic or platelet plug) when a blood vessel is damaged. Fibrin forms in the presence of aggregated platelets, leading to clot formation.  Bleeding associated with thrombocytopenia is often characterized by petechiae, ecchymoses, or mucosal bleeding.  Platelet function disorders are relatively rare and may be inherited or acquired. Overview of Anemia in Animals ByAllison Kendall, DVM, MS, DACVIM, North Carolina State University Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jul 2024 View the Pet Owner Version Anemia is an absolute decrease in RBC numbers, hemoglobin concentration, or PCV. Clinical signs include pale mucous membranes, increased heart rate, and hypotension. Diagnosis can be based on CBC but should be confirmed by additional tests. Treatment can be supportive but often requires addressing the underlying cause. Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (2) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Anemia can be due to loss, destruction, or lack of production of RBCs. On the basis of clinicopathological evidence of a compensatory response by the bone marrow, anemia can be classified as regenerative or nonregenerative (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia).  With regenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds appropriately to the decreased red cell mass by increasing RBC production and releasing reticulocytes. Anemia due to hemorrhage or hemolysis is typically regenerative. A regenerative response takes 3–5 days from the onset of anemia.  With nonregenerative anemia, the bone marrow responds inadequately to the increased need for RBCs. Anemia due to decreased erythropoietin or an abnormality in the bone marrow is nonregenerative. Anemia due to acute hemorrhage or hemolysis initially appears nonregenerative until there has been enough time for a regenerative response.  Pearls & Pitfalls  A regenerative response takes 3–5 days from the onset of anemia.  Table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia Clinical Findings of Anemia in Animals Clinical signs of anemia depend on the extent of the condition, the duration (acute or chronic), and the underlying cause.  Acute Anemia Acute anemia can result in shock and even death if more than a third of the blood volume is lost rapidly and not replaced. In acute blood loss, the following clinical signs are common:  tachycardia  pale mucous membranes  bounding or weak peripheral pulses  hypotension  The cause of the blood loss can be overt (eg, trauma) or occult. If no evidence of external bleeding is found, a source of internal or occult blood loss must be sought; examples include ruptured splenic tumor, other neoplasia, coagulopathy, GI ulceration, and parasites. Hemolysis can result in icterus.  Chronic Anemia Animals with chronic anemia have had time to accommodate, and their clinical presentation is usually more vague, with signs such as the following:  lethargy  weakness  anorexia  Patients with acute or chronic anemia can show similar clinical signs, such as pale mucous membranes and weak peripheral pulses. The lack of expected clinical signs can indicate the time frame of the condition. Splenomegaly, abdominal distention, or heart murmur can be present, depending on the underlying cause of anemia.  Diagnosis of Anemia in Animals Clinical Evaluation A complete history is an important part of evaluating a patient with anemia. Questions covered might include duration of clinical signs, history of exposure to toxins (eg, rodenticides, heavy metals, toxic plants), drug treatments, vaccinations, travel history, and prior illnesses.  Serological Testing A CBC, including platelet and reticulocyte counts, provides information on the severity of anemia and the extent of the bone marrow response, and enables the evaluation of other cell lines.  A blood smear should be evaluated for abnormalities in RBC morphology or size, evidence of agglutination, and RBC parasites. The RBC indices (measures of size and hemoglobin concentration) are calculated by automated cell counters calibrated for the species being examined.  RBC size is expressed by the mean corpuscular volume (MCV) in femtoliters and can reflect the extent of regeneration.  Macrocytosis (increased MCV) usually correlates with regenerative anemia (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia). Macrocytosis can also be due to defects in DNA synthesis or nuclear maturation, as in cobalamin (vitamin B12) deficiency or in cats with myelodysplasia caused by feline leukemia virus. In addition, macrocytosis can be a heritable condition in Poodles without anemia.  Microcytosis (decreased MCV) is the hallmark of iron-deficiency anemia and can also be heritable in Akitas.  The hemoglobin concentration of each RBC, measured in grams per deciliter, is defined as the mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC).  Abnormalities in RBC morphology, such as basophilic stippling, can indicate lead poisoning. The formation of Heinz bodies (see Heinz body images) indicates oxidative injury to the RBCs, secondary to toxin exposure (see the table Toxic Causes of Anemia). Cats are more susceptible to Heinz body formation than are other species; even cats without anemia can have a small number of Heinz bodies.  Heinz bodies, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. Devorah Stowe.  The presence of schistocytes or spherocytes (see spherocyte image) can also help identify the pathophysiological process associated with the cause of anemia (eg, spherocytes are evident in cases of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia).  Spherocytes, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Devorah Stowe.  The reticulocyte count is usually reported as a percentage of the RBC mass. This value should be corrected for the extent of anemia to evaluate the extent of regeneration. An absolute reticulocyte count (measured as RBCs per microliter × reticulocyte percentage) of > 50,000 reticulocytes/mcL in cats or > 60,000 reticulocytes/mcL in dogs is considered regenerative. A corrected reticulocyte percentage > 1% indicates regeneration in dogs and cats (see the table Assessment of Regeneration in Anemia). Corrected reticulocyte percentage is calculated as the observed reticulocyte percentage multiplied by the ratio of the patient’s PCV to the normal PCV for that species.  After acute blood loss or hemolytic crisis, reticulocytosis usually takes 3–4 days to become evident.  Plasma or total protein concentration is also useful for further classifying the cause of anemia. The plasma protein concentration is often low with blood loss but normal (or elevated) in cases of hemolysis and decreased production.  A serum chemistry panel and urinalysis can be used to evaluate organ function. If GI blood loss is suspected, an elevation in BUN or decrease in albumin can be noted, or an examination of the feces for blood and parasites can be useful. With hemolytic anemia, total bilirubin can be elevated.  Radiographic examination can help identify occult disease, such as zinc toxicosis due to the presence of a penny in the stomach of a puppy with hemolytic anemia.  Bruising or bleeding can be a sign of a coagulopathy and indicate the need for a coagulation profile. Petechiae or ecchymotic hemorrhage suggests substantial thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathy.  If anemia due to hemolysis is suspected, blood can be evaluated for autoagglutination, or a direct agglutination test (Coombs test) might be indicated (see Anemia Due to Hemolysis).  Serological tests and PCR assays for infectious agents such as feline leukemia virus, Ehrlichia (which causes ehrlichiosis), equine infectious anemia virus, and Babesia (which causes babesiosis) can also help define the cause of anemia (see the table Infectious Causes of Anemia).  Bone marrow evaluation by aspiration or biopsy is indicated in animals with an unexplained, nonregenerative anemia. If the CBC reveals a decrease in more than one cell line, possibly indicating hypoplastic marrow, a biopsy is indicated, along with aspiration.  Biopsy and aspiration are complementary: biopsies are better to evaluate the architecture and extent of cellularity of the marrow; aspiration enables better evaluation of cellular morphology. Aspiration also enables evaluation of the orderly maturation of RBC and WBC lines, the ratio of myeloid to erythroid precursors (M:E ratio), and the number of platelet precursors. Iron stores can also be evaluated by means of Prussian blue staining.  An M:E ratio < 1 indicates that RBC production is greater than WBC production; an M:E ratio > 1 indicates the opposite. The M:E ratio is always interpreted in light of a recent CBC, because changes in the ratio could also be due to suppression of one cell line compared with the other.  Key Points Anemia can be classified on the basis of chronicity, severity, regenerative response, and RBC indices.  Plasma protein concentration should also be used in classifying the underlying cause of anemia.  Clinical signs depend on the severity and duration (acute versus chronic) of the anemia.  Bone marrow evaluation can be necessary for further characterization of nonregenerative anemia. Regenerative Anemias in Animals ByAllison Kendall, DVM, MS, DACVIM, North Carolina State University Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jul 2024 | Modified Jul 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Anemia Due to Blood Loss | Anemia Due to Hemolysis | Anemia Due to Toxins, Infections, or Heritable Diseases | Key Points | For More Information | References Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (3) Tables (2) Videos (0) Regenerative anemias include anemias due to blood loss, hemolysis (hemolytic anemias), toxins, infections, and heritable diseases.  Anemia Due to Blood Loss in Animals Blood loss anemia is typically regenerative (see blood smear images). Acute blood loss can lead to shock and even death if > 30%–40% of blood is lost and the resulting hypovolemia is not treated aggressively with IV fluid therapy, the administration of compatible blood products, or both.  Regenerative anemia, blood smears, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Causes of acute blood loss can be known (eg, trauma, surgery) or occult (eg, GI blood loss). Coagulopathies, bleeding tumors, gastric ulceration, and external or internal parasites should be excluded as causes. GI parasites, such as Haemonchus in ruminants and hookworms in dogs, can lead to severe blood loss, especially in young animals.  Low-grade, chronic blood loss eventually results in iron-deficiency anemia; however, some reticulocytosis can persist after iron stores have become depleted.  The hallmark of iron-deficiency anemia is microcytic, hypochromic anemia. This chronic blood loss can be due to some type of parasitism in young animals (eg, fleas, lice, intestinal parasitism); in older animals, however, bleeding from GI ulcers or tumors is more common.  Anemia Due to Hemolysis in Animals Hemolytic anemia results from the destruction of RBCs.  Hemolytic anemias are typically regenerative and result from the lysis of RBCs in either the intra- or extravascular space. Intravascular hemolysis results in hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria; extravascular hemolysis does not.  Both types of hemolysis can result in icterus. In dogs, the most common cause of hemolytic anemia is immune mediated (60%–75% of cases). Toxins, RBC trauma, infections, neoplasia, and RBC membrane defects can also cause hemolysis.  Immune-Mediated Hemolytic Anemia Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) can be primary (idiopathic) or secondary to neoplasia, infectious agents, inflammatory diseases, drugs, or vaccinations. The ACVIM consensus statement on IMHA diagnosis in dogs and cats recommends a full diagnostic workup that includes infectious disease testing.  In IMHA, the immune system no longer recognizes RBCs as self, and it develops antibodies against circulating RBCs, leading to RBC destruction by macrophages and complement. In some cases, antibodies are directed against RBC precursors in the marrow, resulting in nonregenerative anemia.  Clinical Signs Animals with IMHA usually have icterus, sometimes have fever, and can have splenomegaly.  Diagnosis The following clinical signs and diagnostic test results are hematological hallmarks of IMHA:  regenerative anemia  hyperbilirubinemia  spherocytosis  autoagglutination (see agglutination image)  a positive Coombs test result  Immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, agglutination   Image Courtesy of Dr. Robert Jacobs.  A definitive diagnosis of IMHA requires at least two clinical signs of immune-mediated destruction (spherocytosis, autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs test result) and at least one clinical sign of hemolysis (hyperbilirubinemia, hemoglobinemia, or hemoglobinuria).  When blood is placed in an EDTA tube or onto a microscope slide, autoagglutination can be appreciated as red blood cells sticking together in three-dimensional clumps. To distinguish autoagglutination from overlapping rouleaux formation or other pseudoagglutination, a saline agglutination test (also called slide agglutination test or saline dispersion test) can be performed:  A drop of saline solution (0.9% NaCl) is placed on a microscope slide with a fresh drop of the animal's blood.  The slide should be gently rotated to mix the drops together.  The slide should be evaluated grossly for macroagglutination (see agglutination image). For microagglutination, a 1:4 or 1:10 dilution of blood to saline solution can be evaluated microscopically as a wet mount.  Animals with IMHA that do not demonstrate autoagglutination can still test positive on a direct agglutination test (Coombs test). Confirmatory testing should be performed before treatment for IMHA is initiated.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Confirmatory testing (Coombs test or flow cytometry) is recommended before immunosuppressive therapy is initiated.  A Coombs test detects antibodies or complement on the erythrocyte surface. Results must be interpreted in light of the sensitivity and specificity of the test. If there is clear evidence of IMHA (spherocytosis and true autoagglutination), a Coombs test may not be necessary.  Another technique used to evaluate patients for anti-RBC antibodies is flow cytometry, which enables the detection and quantitation of IgG and IgM bound to the surface of RBCs. Flow cytometry has been found to be 87%–92% specific for diagnosing patients with anti-RBC antibodies. However, it might not be readily available to all veterinary hospitals. The use of flow cytometry has been suggested to assess the response to treatment (1), because there is a decrease in surface anti-RBC antibodies before reticulocytosis or an increase in RBC count.  Treatment Patients with IMHA can show mild clinical signs or be in acute crisis. It is important to tailor treatment to the patient's clinical signs, including treating any underlying infections. Transfusion with packed RBCs is usually required.  The goal of IMHA treatment is to stop the destruction of RBCs by administering immunosuppressive drugs. Supportive care is also a priority.  Prednisone or prednisolone (2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) in dogs, and prednisolone (2–4 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) in cats, is considered first-line treatment of IMHA. Dexamethasone (0.2–0.4 mg/kg, IV, every 24 hours) can be administered on a temporary basis to patients that will not eat or take oral medications.  Adjunctive immunosuppressive drugs are indicated in IMHA patients that have life-threatening disease, depend on transfusions, or are expected to develop severe adverse effects related to the use of glucocorticoids. Such adjunctive agents include the following (2):  mycophenolate (8–12 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours)  cyclosporine (5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours)  azathioprine (2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours, decreased after 2–3 weeks to 2 mg/kg every 48 hours) in dogs (note that azathioprine is contraindicated in cats and can be replaced by chlorambucil, which has been administered with anecdotal success at 0.1–0.2 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours)  The veterinary literature is ambiguous on how to select a drug adjunctive to corticosteroids and when to introduce it in the treatment of IMHA. The addition of second-line treatment must be tailored to the individual patient, with consideration of adverse effects.  Pulmonary thromboembolism is a risk in dogs with IMHA. These dogs are often hypercoagulable, which can be documented by thromboelastography.  Dogs documented to be in a hypercoagulable state should be anticoagulated with heparin, which, if the platelet count is > 40,000/mcL, can be administered in combination with an antiplatelet (aspirin at 1–2 mg/kg every 24 hours or clopidogrel at 1–4 mg/kg every 24 hours). The ACVIM consensus statement on IMHA treatment in dogs suggests that clopidogrel be administered in preference to aspirin.  The dosing range for heparin is wide and variable, and it depends on whether the heparin is fractionated or unfractionated. Heparin treatment can be monitored by measuring activated partial thromboplastin time (APTT) or antifactor Xa concentrations (low-molecular-weight heparin).  Thromboprophylaxis should be initiated at the time of diagnosis and continued until the patient is in remission and no longer receiving prednisone or prednisolone.  Mortality rates for IMHA range from 20% to 75%, depending on the severity of clinical signs and the extent of hypercoagulability. Negative prognostic indicators can include the following:  rapid drop in PCV  high bilirubin concentration  moderate to marked leukocytosis (28,000 to > 40,000 cells/mcL)  increased BUN concentration  petechiae  intravascular hemolysis  autoagglutination  disseminated intravascular coagulation  thromboembolic complications  Moderate to marked leukocytosis has been reported as associated with tissue necrosis, most likely secondary to tissue hypoxia or thromboembolic disease. Referral to tertiary care facilities and consideration of extracorporeal treatments (eg, plasmapheresis) can improve the outcome.  Alloimmune Hemolytic Anemia Alloimmune hemolytic anemia is caused by alloantibodies against nonself erythrocyte antigens. Examples include hemolytic transfusion reactions and neonatal isoerythrolysis.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis (NI) is an immune-mediated hemolytic disease that occurs in neonatal horses, mules, cattle, pigs, cats, and, rarely, dogs.  NI results when the neonate ingests maternal colostrum containing antibodies against one of the neonate’s blood group antigens. The maternal antibodies develop against specific foreign blood group antigens during previous pregnancies, as a result of unmatched transfusions, and from Babesia and Anaplasma vaccinations in cattle.  Cats are unique in that cats with blood type B have naturally occurring anti-A antibodies without prior exposure, and their kittens with blood type A develop hemolysis after nursing.  In horses, the antigens usually involved are A, C, and Q. NI occurs most commonly in Thoroughbreds and mules.  Neonates with NI are apparently normal at birth; however, they develop severe hemolytic anemia within 2–3 days and become weak and icteric (see icteric mucous membranes image).  Diagnosis is confirmed by screening of maternal serum, plasma, or colostrum and comparison to the paternal or neonatal RBCs.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis, icteric mucous membranes, foal   Image Courtesy of Dr. Thomas Lane.  Treatment of NI consists of stopping any colostrum, supportive care, and blood transfusions. If necessary, neonates can be transfused with triple-washed maternal RBCs.  NI can be avoided by withholding maternal colostrum and giving colostrum from a maternal source free of the antibodies. The newborn’s RBCs can be mixed with maternal serum to look for agglutination before the newborn is allowed to receive maternal colostrum.  Microangiopathic Hemolytic Anemia Microangiopathic hemolytic anemia results from RBC damage secondary to turbulent flow through abnormal vessels.  In dogs, it can occur secondary to severe heartworm infection, vascular tumors (hemangiosarcoma), splenic torsions, and disseminated intravascular coagulation.  Causes in other species include hemolytic uremic syndrome in calves, equine infectious anemia, African swine fever, and chronic classical swine fever.  Schistocytes are common in blood smears from animals with microangiopathic hemolytic anemia. Treatment is to correct the underlying disease process.  Metabolic Causes of Hemolytic Anemia Hypophosphatemia causes postparturient hemolysis and hemoglobinuria in cattle, sheep, and goats. It can occur 2–6 weeks after parturition.  In dogs and cats, hypophosphatemia with secondary hemolysis occurs secondary to diabetes mellitus, hepatic lipidosis, and refeeding syndrome. Oral or IV administration of phosphorus is indicated, depending on the extent of hypophosphatemia.  Cattle that drink too much water (water intoxication) are at risk of developing hemolysis secondary to hypotonic plasma. Such cases occur in calves 2–10 months old and lead to respiratory distress and hemoglobinuria. Clinical signs can progress to seizures and coma.  Diagnosis of water intoxication in calves is suggested by hemolytic anemia, hyponatremia and hypochloremia, decreased serum osmolality, and low urine specific gravity. Treatment consists of hypertonic fluids (eg, hypertonic saline solution [2.5% NaCl]) and diuretics (eg, mannitol).  Anemia Due to Toxins, Infections, or Heritable Diseases in Animals Toxins Toxins and drugs can cause anemia via many mechanisms. Those implicated most frequently in animals, along with their pathogenic mechanisms, are listed in the table Toxic Causes of Anemia.  Table Toxic Causes of Anemia Infections Many infectious agents can cause anemia by direct damage to RBCs, leading to hemolysis, or by direct effects on precursors in the bone marrow (see the table Infectious Causes of Anemia).  Table Infectious Causes of Anemia Heritable Diseases Several heritable RBC disorders lead to anemia.  Pyruvate kinase deficiencies occur in Basenjis, Beagles, West Highland White Terriers, Cairn Terriers, and other dog breeds, as well as Abyssinian and Somali cats. There is no treatment for pyruvate kinase deficiency.  Dogs with pyruvate kinase deficiency have a shortened lifespan because of myelofibrosis and osteosclerosis of the bone marrow. Affected cats have chronic intermittent hemolytic anemia, which is sometimes helped by splenectomy and corticosteroids. Cats have not been reported to develop osteosclerosis.  Phosphofructokinase deficiency occurs in English Springer Spaniels. Deficiencies in these enzymes lead to shortened RBC lifespan and regenerative anemia. In dogs with phosphofructokinase deficiency, the hemolytic crises are set off by alkalosis secondary to excessive excitement or exercise. If such situations are minimized, affected dogs can have a normal life expectancy.  A hereditary hemoglobinopathy, porphyria, leads to a buildup of porphyrins in the body and has been described in cattle, cats, and pigs. It is most prevalent in Holstein cattle and can result in a hemolytic crisis. Affected calves fail to thrive and are photosensitive. Diagnosis is based on a finding of increased concentrations of porphyrins in bone marrow, urine, or plasma. Teeth of affected animals fluoresce under ultraviolet light.  Key Points  Hematological hallmarks of immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) are hyperbilirubinemia, spherocytosis, autoagglutination, or a positive Coombs test result.  IMHA is commonly treated with supportive care, along with immunosuppression and anticoagulants.  Neonatal isoerythrolysis is an immune-mediated hemolytic disease that results from the ingestion of maternal colostrum containing antibodies against one of the neonate’s blood group antigens.  Other causes of regenerative anemias include hypophosphatemia, drugs, and toxins. Nonregenerative Anemias in Animals ByAllison Kendall, DVM, MS, DACVIM, North Carolina State University Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Jul 2024 | Modified May 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Anemia Due to Nutritional Deficiency | Anemia Due to Chronic Disease | Anemia Due to Renal Disease | Anemia Due to Primary Bone Marrow Diseases | Key Points | For More Information Nonregenerative anemias can be due to nutritional deficiencies, chronic disease, renal disease, and primary bone marrow diseases. Acute anemia is initially nonregenerative, until regeneration occurs in 3–4 days; if there's no evidence of regeneration in that time frame, it is classified as nonregenerative.  Anemia Due to Nutritional Deficiency in Animals Nutritional deficiency anemias develop when micronutrients needed for RBC formation are not present in adequate amounts. Anemia develops gradually and can initially be regenerative; ultimately, however, it becomes nonregenerative. Starvation leads to anemia because of a combination of vitamin and mineral deficiencies, as well as a negative energy and protein balance.  Deficiencies most likely to cause anemia include the following:  cobalamin (vitamin B12)  copper  iron  niacin  pyridoxine (vitamin B6)  riboflavin  vitamin C (important only in primates and guinea pigs)  vitamin E  Iron deficiency is the most common deficiency in dogs and piglets; it occurs less commonly in horses, cats, and ruminants. Iron deficiency is rarely nutritional in origin; it most commonly occurs secondary to chronic blood loss. Young animals have minimal iron stores, and milk contains very little iron. These factors can be especially important for piglets, which grow rapidly and are often raised indoors with no access to iron. Oral or injectable iron supplementation is indicated as a treatment for iron deficiency, and any source of blood loss must be corrected.  Copper is necessary for the metabolism of iron. Copper deficiency can develop in ruminants fed forage grown in copper-deficient soil, and it can occur secondary to high dietary molybdenum or sulfate in cattle and in pigs fed whey diets. Low blood copper concentrations or low copper concentrations in liver biopsies (more definitive) are diagnostic. Treatment is oral or injectable copper supplementation.  B vitamin deficiencies are rare. Because intestinal malabsorption can contribute to deficiency, measurement of serum cobalamin (vitamin B12) and folate concentrations is recommended for dogs or cats with chronic GI signs.  Certain drugs (eg, anticonvulsants or drugs that interfere with folate metabolism) have been associated with development of folate or cobalamin deficiency, leading to a normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia.  Cobalamin malabsorption independent of underlying GI disease has been reported in Giant Schnauzers, Beagles, Border Collies, and Australian Shepherds (their enterocytes are unable to absorb cobalamin). These dogs respond to parenteral supplementation with cobalamin.  Ruminants develop a secondary cobalamin deficiency when grazing on cobalt-deficient pasture. Treatment with oral cobalt or parenteral cobalamin is indicated.  Anemia Due to Chronic Disease in Animals Anemia resulting from chronic disease can be characterized as mild to moderate, nonregenerative, normochromic, and normocytic. It is the most common form of mild anemia in animals. The anemia can be secondary to chronic inflammation or infection, neoplasia, liver disease, hyperadrenocorticism or hypoadrenocorticism, or hypothyroidism.  Anemia due to chronic disease is mediated by cytokines produced by inflammatory cells, which lead to decreases in iron availability, RBC survival, and the marrow’s ability to regenerate. Treatment should be directed at the underlying disease and often results in resolution of the anemia.  Anemia Due to Renal Disease in Animals Chronic kidney disease is a common cause of nonregenerative anemia in animals. Erythropoietin is normally produced by the peritubular endothelial cells in the renal cortex. Animals with renal disease produce less erythropoietin, leading to anemia.  Anemia associated with renal disease should be treated, because it can worsen the renal disease clinical signs and the patient's quality of life and can cause the progression of chronic kidney disease.  Erythropoiesis-stimulating agents can be used to treat anemia that is due to renal disease. Compared with recombinant human erythropoietin (epoetin alfa), darbepoetin is hyperglycosylated and, anecdotally, associated with a lower risk of subsequent red cell aplasia. The recommended starting dose is 1 mcg/kg, SC, once weekly in cats, and 0.5–1 mcg/kg, SC, once weekly in dogs. PCV is monitored weekly until the desired improvement is reached (the duration of treatment varies with the initial extent of the anemia), after which the dose interval is increased and PCV continues to be monitored.  Potential adverse effects of darbepoetin include pure red cell aplasia and hypertension; therefore, it is important to monitor PCV and blood pressure. Patients administered darbepoetin or recombinant human erythropoietin require supplemental iron to support RBC production. (Also see Hematinics.)  Molidustat oral suspension has received conditional approval for managing chronic kidney disease–associated anemia in cats. The conditional approval requires that the drug be administered to cats only at 5 mg/kg every 24 hours for 28 days, followed by a required pause of ≥ 7 days. PCV should be monitored during this pause, and when it decreases to < 28%, molidustat oral suspension can be administered for another 28 days followed by the required pause. Vomiting is the most common adverse effect of the drug.   Anemia Due to Primary Bone Marrow Diseases in Animals Primary bone marrow disease or failure from any cause can lead to nonregenerative anemia and pancytopenia. With diffuse marrow involvement, granulocytes are affected first, followed by platelets and finally RBCs.  Aplastic Anemia Aplastic anemia has been reported in dogs, cats, ruminants, horses, and pigs with pancytopenia and a hypoplastic marrow, replaced by fat. Most cases are idiopathic; reported causes include infection (eg, feline leukemia virus disease, ehrlichiosis, parvovirus infection), drug treatment (eg, methimazole, chemotherapeutic agents, antimicrobials [trimethoprim-sulfa, chloramphenicol], fenbendazole), toxin ingestion (eg, estrogen), and total body irradiation (see the tables Toxic Causes of Anemia and Infectious Causes of Anemia.  Aplastic anemia can also have an immune-mediated component, which is more common in dogs than in cats.  Diagnosis of aplastic anemia is confirmed by bone marrow aspiration and biopsy.  Treatment consists of eliminating the underlying cause and providing supportive care such as broad-spectrum antimicrobials and transfusions. Immunosuppressive agents such as prednisone or prednisolone, cyclosporine, mycophenolate, or azathioprine can be considered.  Recombinant human erythropoietin and granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (5 mcg/kg, SC, every 24 hours) can be administered until the marrow recovers. If the disease is idiopathic or if marrow recovery is unlikely (eg, as with phenylbutazone toxicosis in dogs), bone marrow transplantation is beneficial if a suitable donor is available.  Pure Red Cell Aplasia In pure red cell aplasia, only the erythroid line is affected. Pure red cell aplasia is characterized by a nonregenerative anemia with severe depletion of RBC precursors in the bone marrow.  Pure red cell aplasia has been reported in dogs and cats and can be primary or secondary. Primary cases are most commonly immune mediated and can respond to immunosuppressive therapy. Supportive care, including transfusion, can be indicated when the anemia is severe.  Cats with feline leukemia virus infection can have pure red cell aplasia. Recombinant human erythropoietin has been reported to cause pure red cell aplasia in dogs and horses. Discontinuation of treatment can eventually lead to RBC recovery in some animals.  Primary Leukemias Primary leukemias are uncommon to rare in domestic species; however, they have been reported in dogs, cats, cattle, goats, sheep, pigs, and horses. Retroviruses are a cause in some cattle, cats, primates, and chickens.  Leukemias can develop in myeloid or lymphoid cell lines and are further classified as acute or chronic. Most affected animals have nonregenerative anemia, neutropenia, and thrombocytopenia, with circulating blast cells usually present.  Acute leukemias, characterized by infiltration of the marrow with blasts, generally respond poorly to chemotherapy. In patients that do respond, remission times are usually short. In acute lymphoblastic leukemia in dogs, the response rate to chemotherapy is approximately 30%, with a median survival time of 4 months. Acute myeloblastic leukemias are less common and even less responsive to treatment than acute lymphoblastic leukemia. In acute leukemias, the cell lineage is often difficult to identify morphologically, so cytochemical stains or immunological evaluation of cell-surface markers can be necessary for definitive diagnosis.  Chronic leukemias, characterized by an overproduction of one hematopoietic cell line, are less likely to cause anemia and more responsive to treatment.  Myelodysplasia Myelodysplasia (myelodysplastic syndrome, MDS) is considered a preleukemic syndrome characterized by ineffective hematopoiesis, resulting in a nonregenerative anemia or other cytopenias. MDS has been described in dogs, cats, and humans.  MDS can be primary or secondary and is common in cats with feline leukemia virus infection. Primary syndromes probably arise from mutations in stem cells. Secondary syndromes result from other neoplasia or drug treatment.  Some cats and dogs respond to treatment of MDS with recombinant human erythropoietin and prednisone. Supportive care with transfusions can be helpful. Survival varies because MDS can progress to leukemia; many affected animals are euthanized or die of sepsis, bleeding, or anemia.  Myelofibrosis Myelofibrosis causes bone marrow failure secondary to replacement of normal marrow elements with fibrous tissue. The disorder has been reported in dogs, cats, humans, and goats.  Myelofibrosis can be a primary disorder or secondary to malignancies, immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, whole body irradiation, and congenital anemias (eg, pyruvate kinase deficiency). Diagnosis can be based on bone marrow biopsy.  Treatment of myelofibrosis varies with the underlying cause but usually consists of immunosuppressive therapy.  Bone Marrow Aspiration and Biopsy Bone marrow aspiration and biopsy are techniques used to evaluate the bone marrow in domestic animal species. The basic technique is to introduce a hollow needle into the bone to obtain a marrow sample for evaluation. Aspiration provides a sample for cytological evaluation; biopsy provides a sample for histological evaluation. The equipment for these procedures can differ slightly.  The following are indications for bone marrow evaluation:  nonregenerative anemia  thrombocytopenia  leukopenia  bicytopenia  pancytopenia  abnormal circulating cells of any type  monoclonal gammopathy  suspected osteomyelitis  suspected bone neoplasia  infectious disease affecting the bone  clinical staging of neoplastic processes such as lymphoma and mast cell disease  The conventional anatomical sites for bone marrow aspiration include the iliac crest, the trochanteric fossa of the femur, the tibial crest, and the greater tubercle of the humerus. Some clinicians have also used the rib (costochondral junction) or sternebrae. The humerus is the most common site for bone marrow biopsy.  Aspiration Procedure Cats and dogs generally require heavy sedation for bone marrow aspiration; some cats can require general anesthesia. The procedure is as follows:  The patient is placed in one of two positions:  Lateral recumbency for the trochanteric fossa or greater tubercle  Sternal recumbency for the iliac crest  The area to be accessed is shaved and aseptically prepared.  The site, including the periosteum, is infiltrated with local anesthetic.  A scalpel with a No. 11 blade is used to make a stab incision through the skin.  An aspiration needle is inserted into the bone through the incision.  Most bone marrow aspiration needles (eg, Rosenthal, Illinois) are very similar and have a removable stylet. With the stylet in place, the needle is advanced with a back-and-forth screwing motion until the needle is well seated in the bone.  The stylet is removed from the needle, and a 6- to 12-mL syringe is attached for aspiration. This step is the most likely one to cause the patient some discomfort.  A small sample is drawn into the syringe (only enough to fill the hub is required).  The needle is removed.  The sample is put onto slides for cytological evaluation.  Biopsy Procedure Bone marrow biopsy requires general anesthesia. The procedure is similar to that for bone marrow aspiration (see above), except that it requires a Jamshidi needle, which is rigid and hollow with a stylet. The Jamshidi needle has a cutting edge at its end, designed to obtain a core marrow sample (it can also be used to obtain a bone marrow aspirate). Once the needle is well seated in the bone, the cap is unscrewed and the stylet removed.  An aspirate can be obtained as described above. To obtain a core sample for histological evaluation, the needle is advanced further (by approximately 0.6 cm, or a quarter inch) into the marrow while twisting in one direction. The needle is then moved in a wide, circular motion to try to dislodge a core sample.  The needle is removed by twisting in the opposite direction in which it was advanced. A blunt stylet is then passed retrograde to remove the core sample.  The core can be gently rolled onto a slide for cytology and then placed into formalin for histological examination.  Key Points  Nonregenerative anemia may be due to nutritional deficiency, chronic disease, renal disease, or bone marrow disease.  Bone marrow aspiration is a safe procedure that is most commonly indicated for diagnosing peripheral blood abnormalities.  Bone marrow aspiration enables cytological evaluation of cell morphology and cell lines.  Bone marrow biopsy enables histological evaluation of architecture. Blood Groups in Dogs and Cats ByShauna Blois, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM-SAIM, University of Guelph, Ontario Veterinary College Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2024 View the Pet Owner Version Canine Blood Groups | Feline Blood Groups | For More Information A blood type, or blood group, is based on the inherited antigens on an RBC surface:  The major blood group antigens on canine erythrocytes are classified as dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA).  Blood group antigens in cats are classified according to the AB system.  Other blood groups have been recognized outside of the DEA and AB systems.  Exposure to foreign erythrocyte antigens (eg, via blood transfusion) can induce alloantibodies against these antigens in dogs and cats. Cats can have strong naturally occurring alloantibodies (NOAbs) against nonself blood types.    Canine Blood Groups Recognized DEA blood groups include DEA 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. DEA 1 is considered the most clinically relevant blood type in dogs. Historically, DEA 1 was subtyped into DEA 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3; however, quantitative differences in DEA 1 antigenic expression explain these subtypes. DEA 1 is now described as negative, weak positive, and 2+ to 4+ positive. Depending on geographic area, approximately 33–65% of dogs are DEA 1-positive. Anti-DEA 1 antibodies can be induced in DEA 1-negative dogs by transfusion with DEA 1-positive blood, leading to future hemolytic transfusion reactions.   Other identified canine blood groups include Dal, the Japanese D1D2 system, and Kai 1 and 2.  The Dal antigen is present on the surface of most canine erythrocytes, and therefore most dogs are considered Dal-positive. Breeds frequently negative for Dal include Doberman Pinschers, Dalmatians, and Shih Tzu, as well as Lhasa Apsos and Bichons Frises to a lesser extent. Exposure of Dal-negative dogs to Dal-positive erythrocytes leads to sensitization and hemolytic transfusion reactions upon repeated exposure.    Feline Blood Groups The AB blood group is the predominant feline blood grouping system.  Cats are most commonly positive for type A, although prevalence of type B varies geographically and by breed. Rarely, cats are positive for A and B antigens (type AB). The A antigen is inherited as a simple autosomal trait with A being dominant over B. The mode of inheritance for type AB is not known.   The common erythrocyte antigen Mik was previously identified on the erythrocyte surface of most cats. Mik-negative cats can have NOAbs against Mik. In 2021, 5 novel feline erythrocyte antigen (FEA) blood groups were identified (designated FEA 1–5). NOAbs to these antigens can be present in cats that do not express the corresponding antigens.  Typing reagents for Mik are no longer available; however, FEA 1 might correspond to the previously identified Mik antigen.

The minor crossmatch test combines the donor's plasma (or serum) with the recipient's RBCs, assessing for the risk of transfusing alloantibodies from the donor that will destroy the recipient's RBCs.  Crossmatching can be performed in reference laboratories or in clinics manually using a tube or slide method. Point-of-care gel and immunochromatographic commercial crossmatch options are also available and have variable reported agreement with laboratory methods.  Incompatible donor-recipient pairings result in agglutination and entrapment of RBCs within the gel matrix or on the immunochromatographic membrane, signifying a positive (incompatible) reaction (see gel crossmatch test image).  Gel crossmatch test, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Shauna Blois.  Crossmatching is not required before a first transfusion in a dog, due to the lack of naturally occurring alloantibodies (NOAbs), but is strongly recommended > 4 days after a subsequent transfusion.  Due to the presence of highly immunogenic NOAbs in cats, major crossmatching is strongly recommended both before a first transfusion in cats and then > 2 days after any subsequent transfusion.  Screening of Blood Donors and Blood Banking Considerations in Dogs and Cats ByShauna Blois, DVM, DVSc, DACVIM-SAIM, University of Guelph, Ontario Veterinary College Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2024 Blood donors require screening to ensure good health and negative status for geographically relevant infectious diseases that could be transmitted via blood transfusion, including vector-borne diseases in dogs and cats as well as retroviruses in cats. Infectious disease screening guidelines are available for canine and feline blood donors.   Blood is collected aseptically into blood collection bags containing anticoagulant. Blood collected from a blood donor can be left as whole blood or split into packed RBCs, plasma, and platelet components. RBC products are stored at 2–6°C for 21–42 days. Plasma is considered “fresh frozen” when stored at −20°C for up to 1 year and considered “frozen” after 1 year.  When available, component therapy is used to replace only the components of blood required to decrease risk of transfusion reaction and optimize blood resources.  Packed RBCs are used to replace RBCs, especially in cases of hemolysis or lack of RBC production where plasma is not required. Whole blood is best suited for patients with blood loss.   Assessment for transfusion triggers or clinical signs of anemia, rather than reliance on a hematocrit cutoff value, is most helpful for deciding whether an RBC transfusion is needed. Clinical signs of weakness, tachycardia, tachypnea, hypotension, or elevated lactate concentration can indicate the need for RBC transfusion in anemic patients.  Hemoglobin-based oxygen carrier solutions (eg, bovine origin) are no longer available as RBC product substitutes. Similar products might be available in the future.  Plasma transfusion is indicated for hemorrhage secondary to coagulopathy and colloid support.  Fresh frozen plasma contains all coagulation factors, von Willebrand factor, albumin, antiproteases, and immunoglobulins; frozen plasma contains most of these components, aside from the labile coagulation factors V and VIII. Cryoprecipitate is a concentrated plasma source of fibrinogen, von Willebrand factor, factor VIII complex, factor XIII, and fibronectin.  Plasma transfusion is an inefficient method for replacing albumin in hypoalbuminemic patients. Commercially available lyophilized canine albumin is a concentrated albumin product suitable for treatment of hypovolemic shock and hypoalbuminemia. Transfusion of human serum albumin has been reported in dogs previously, although risk of severe hypersensitivity reactions now contraindicates use of this product.  Platelet-rich plasma and platelet concentrate can be made when whole blood products are processed into components; dimethyl sulfoxide-cryopreserved canine platelet concentrate is commercially available. Lyophilized canine platelets have been reported in the literature as useful for transfusion but are not commercially available.  Whole blood stored at room temperature for up to 8 hours is also a source of platelets, although it is a less concentrated source than platelet products. Platelets are thought to have a relatively short lifespan (up to a few days) after transfusion and are used for uncontrolled or life-threatening hemorrhage secondary to thrombocytopenia or thrombocytopathia, or as component therapy in massive transfusions.

Only pumps approved for blood products (or gravity flow, without a pump) should be used for delivering blood transfusion.  Transfusion rate depends on patient condition, with rapid rates warranted in individuals with hemodynamic instability and slower delivery (over 4 hours) in more stable patients. Slower transfusion rates are indicated in patients with cardiac disease or renal insufficiency.  Calcium-containing fluids cannot be administered with blood products, and medications should not be administered with the blood transfusion. RBCs remain in the refrigerator until just before use, while frozen plasma products are thawed immediately before use.   Blood product filter, cat   Image Courtesy of Dr. Shauna Blois.  All blood donors and recipients should be typed for dog erythrocyte antigen (DEA) 1 (dogs) or AB (cats) before transfusion to allow transfusion of type-matched RBC products. While DEA 1-positive dogs can receive DEA 1-negative RBC products without risk of incompatibility, use of DEA 1-positive blood products in DEA 1-positive recipients allows for prudent management of blood bank resources.  Dogs with DEA 1 weak positive blood type warrant special consideration in transfusion, due to the unknown immunological risk of transfusing DEA 1 strongly positive blood to a DEA 1 weak positive dog. A DEA 1 weak positive blood donor is treated as DEA 1-positive, while a DEA 1 weak positive recipient should receive DEA 1-negative blood.   The volume of RBCs transfused can be calculated based on the desired posttransfusion PCV. Patients do not require a normal PCV to achieve hemodynamic stability.  Transfusion volume (in mL) can be calculated as follows:   Packed RBC volume to transfuse = ([desired PCV – recipient's PCV]/unit PCV) × BV × BW  where BV is the recipient's total blood volume (in mL/kg) estimated as 40–60 mL/kg in cats and 80–90 mL/kg in dogs, and BW is body weight (in kg).  For coagulopathies, the recommended dose of plasma to transfuse is 10–20 mL/kg (dogs) or 6–10 mL/kg (cats).  Plasma is not efficient for treatment of hypoproteinemia, but volume of plasma (in mL) can be calculated as the following:  Volume of plasma to transfuse = ([desired TP – recipient's TP]/unit TP) × BV × BW  where TP is total protein, BV is the recipient's total blood volume (in mL/kg) estimated as 40–60 mL/kg in cats and 80–90 mL/kg in dogs, and BW is body weight (in kg).  Canine lyophilized albumin is reconstituted to various concentrations just before use depending on need. A 5% solution is recommended for normovolemic dogs. Dosing to achieve a patient albumin level of 2–2.5 g/dL is recommended; 450 mg/kg is needed to raise serum albumin by 0.5 g/dL.   Platelet-rich plasma, platelet concentrate, and cryopreserved platelet transfusions are dosed at 1 unit per 10 kg of recipient's body weight and administered within 2 hours.   If patient condition permits, many clinics use a test dose before administering an RBC transfusion, giving a small amount of blood (eg, 0.25 mL/kg for 15 minutes) and closely monitoring for clinical signs of a transfusion reaction. If no concerns are noted, the transfusion proceeds at the indicated rate.   Risks of Blood Transfusion in Dogs and Cats Transfusion recipients should be closely monitored throughout and after the transfusion. Vital signs should be assessed every 15 minutes during the first hour, hourly until cessation of the transfusion, then at 15 minutes, 1 hour, and 24 hours after the transfusion is finished. Patients should be assessed immediately if any clinical signs of a reaction are suspected. PCV can be assessed when RBC transfusion is completed to evaluate transfusion efficacy.    Fever Fever is one of the most common clinical signs of a transfusion reaction. A febrile nonhemolytic transfusion reaction (FNHTR) is defined as a body temperature > 39°C (102.2°F) and an increase in temperature of > 1°C (1.8°F), during or within 4 hours of a transfusion, with no other identified causes. An FNHTR is a mild and self-limiting reaction secondary to transfusion of leukocyte and platelet antigens, as well as proinflammatory mediators, and does not require treatment. More severe transfusion reactions can also present with fever; therefore, fever should prompt complete patient assessment.  Use of leukoreduced blood products has been associated with decreased rates of FNHTR in dogs.    Hemolysis Hemolysis can be due to nonimmunological causes (eg, damage to RBCs transfused from improper storage or administration techniques) or to immunological causes from type II hypersensitivity (antigen-antibody) reactions. The most common example of an immunological acute hemolytic transfusion reaction (AHTR) is transfusion of a blood type against which the recipient has antibodies.  Clinical signs of AHTR can range in severity from fever, tachycardia, and dyspnea to hypotension, shock, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. AHTRs are characterized by an inadequate increase in PCV after transfusion and clinical signs of hemolysis (eg, new hyperbilirubinemia or hemoglobinemia, presence of spherocytes, presence of ghost cells). Fever might be present.  In the case of an AHTR, the transfusion must be stopped and fluid resuscitation and other supportive care initiated as needed. Delayed hemolytic transfusion reactions can occur secondary to immunological incompatibilities and are often not clinically detectable other than by an accelerated decline in PCV > 24 hours after RBC transfusion.   Respiratory Distress Respiratory distress transfusion reactions are most commonly due to transfusion-associated circulatory overload (TACO).  Clinical signs of TACO include new onset of respiratory distress (eg, tachypnea, cough) during or within 24 hours after the transfusion. Radiographic signs of enlarged pulmonary venous vasculature or pulmonary parenchymal infiltrates, cardiac ultrasonogram showing enlarged left atrial to aortic ratio, or new increases in BNP (brain natriuretic peptide) concentration support a diagnosis of TACO.  TACO is treated by stopping the transfusion, judicious use of diuretics, and supportive care.  Transfusion-related acute lung injury is not commonly reported in veterinary patients.    Acute Allergic Reactions Acute allergic reactions cause a range of clinical signs during or within a few hours of a transfusion. Canine allergic reactions typically involve the skin and GI tract, with urticaria, edema, and vomiting commonly reported. Feline allergic reactions are primarily respiratory in nature and can cause dyspnea, although skin and GI signs can also occur. More severe allergic and anaphylactic reactions can cause hypotension and shock. Antihistamines are used to treat mild allergic reactions.  For clinical signs of anaphylaxis, epinephrine and other supportive care, as indicated, are administered.   Infection Transfusion-transmitted infection reactions arise after transfusion of pathogen-contaminated blood products. Clinical signs depend on the pathogen transmitted. Bacterial contamination of blood products can lead to a range of clinical signs, including vomiting, fever, and shock. Samples of the transfused product and of the recipient's blood should be cultured to investigate suspected bacterial contamination.  Xenotransfusion Transfusion of canine blood to a feline recipient (xenotransfusion) has been occasionally reported as an option for transfusing cats, especially when type B blood is not available for a type B recipient. Transfused canine RBCs have a short half-life in feline recipients, and there is risk of AHTR. Crossmatching is recommended before xenotransfusion to identify the most suitable transfusion product. Xenotransfusion is only indicated if all other compatible species-specific transfusion options are exhausted and warrants close consultation with clients regarding associated risks.  Neonatal Isoerythrolysis Type B queens have high titer, naturally occurring alloantibodies against type A erythrocytes, and their colostrum contains a high concentration of these anti-A antibodies. Type A or AB offspring born to a type B queen acquire anti-A antibodies in colostrum. In a neonate during the first 24 hours after birth, intestinal permeability is increased, and antibodies are absorbed systemically, leading to hemolysis. Consequently, during this period, type A and AB kittens should receive alternative feeding. Because intestinal permeability decreases within 24 hours of birth, kittens can return to nurse from the queen 24 hours after birth. Genotyping can identify B/B breeding pairs to prevent neonatal isoerythrolysis.   Key Points Blood typing for DEA 1 is strongly recommended before transfusion in dogs; AB blood typing is essential before transfusion in cats.   Cats can have naturally occurring alloantibodies against other blood types; both cats and dogs can acquire antibodies against nonself blood types through transfusion exposure.   Major crossmatching is recommended in dogs > 4 days after any transfusion and in cats, regardless of previous transfusion history, > 2 days after prior transfusion to decrease risk of immunological incompatibility between blood donors and recipients.

Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 Anaplasmosis is a tickborne disease of ruminants caused by intracellular bacteria that infect red blood cells, causing fever and anemia. Diagnosis relies upon Giemsa-stained blood smears and serologic tests such as ELISA. Key treatments include tetracyclines and imidocarb; in some countries, less pathogenic species are used as live vaccines for the control of bovine anaplasmosis. Etiology and Pathogenesis | Transmission and Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment, Control, and Prevention | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (0) Videos (0)  Anaplasmosis traditionally refers to a disease of ruminants caused by obligate intraerythrocytic bacteria of the order Rickettsiales, family Anaplasmataceae, genus Anaplasma. Cattle, sheep, goats, buffalo, and some wild ruminants can be infected with the erythrocytic Anaplasma. Anaplasmosis occurs in tropical and subtropical regions worldwide (~40°N to 32°S), including South and Central America, the USA, southern Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia.  The Anaplasma genus also includes A phagocytophilum (compiled from species previously known as Ehrlichia phagocytophila, E equi, and human granulocytic ehrlichiosis agent, A bovis (formerly E bovis), and A platys (formerly E platys), all of which invade blood cells other than erythrocytes of their respective mammalian hosts. Bovine anaplasmosis is of economic significance in the cattle industry. A phagocytophilum is the causative agent of equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis.  Etiology and Pathogenesis of Anaplasmosis Clinical bovine anaplasmosis is usually caused by A marginale. A centrale was isolated in South Africa from cattle with a mild disease and is often used as a vaccine to protect from A marginale infections. A ovis may cause mild to severe disease in sheep, deer, and goats and is less common than A marginale infection. A phagocytophilum has recently been reported to infect cattle; however, natural infection is rare and it does not cause clinical disease.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Anaplasmosis in Ruminants Up to 17 different tick vector species (including Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus, Ixodes, Hyalomma, and Argas) have been reported to transmit Anaplasma spp (except A centrale found naturally in South Africa from R simus ticks only). Not all of these are likely significant vectors in the field, and it has been shown that strains of A marginale also coevolve with particular tick strains. Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp are major vectors of A marginale in Australia and Africa, and Dermacentor spp are the main vectors in the USA. Mechanical transmission via biting dipterans occurs in some regions. Anaplasmosis may also be spread through the use of contaminated needles or dehorning or other surgical instruments.  There is a strong correlation between age of cattle and severity of disease. Calves are much more resistant to disease (although not infection) than older cattle. This resistance is not due to colostral antibody from immune dams. In endemic areas where cattle first become infected with A marginale early in life, losses due to anaplasmosis are minimal. After recovery from the acute phase of infection, cattle remain chronically infected carriers but are generally immune to further clinical disease. However, these chronically infected cattle may relapse to anaplasmosis when immunosuppressed (eg, by corticosteroids), when infected with other pathogens, or after splenectomy. Carriers serve as a reservoir for further transmission. Serious losses occur when mature cattle with no previous exposure are moved into endemic areas or under endemically unstable situations when transmission rates are insufficient to ensure that all cattle are infected before reaching the more susceptible adult age.  Clinical Findings of Anaplasmosis In animals < 1 year old, anaplasmosis is usually subclinical, in yearlings and 2-year-olds it is moderately severe, and in older cattle it is severe and often fatal. Anaplasmosis is characterized by progressive anemia due to extravascular destruction of infected and uninfected erythrocytes. The prepatent period of A marginale is directly related to the infective dose and typically ranges from 15–36 days (although it may be as long as 100 days). After the prepatent period, peracute (most severe but rare), acute, or chronic anaplasmosis may follow. Rickettsemia approximately doubles every 24 hours during the exponential growth phase. Generally, 10%–30% of erythrocytes are infected at peak rickettsemia, although this figure may be as high as 65%. RBC count, PCV, and hemoglobin values are all severely reduced. Macrocytic anemia with circulating reticulocytes may be present late in the disease.  Animals with peracute infections succumb within a few hours of the onset of clinical signs. Acutely infected animals lose condition rapidly. Milk production falls. Inappetence, loss of coordination, breathlessness when exerted, and a rapid, bounding pulse are usually evident in the late stages. The urine may be brown, but, in contrast to babesiosis, hemoglobinuria does not occur. A transient febrile response, with the body temperature rarely exceeding 106°F (41°C) occurs at about the time of peak rickettsemia. Mucous membranes appear pale and then yellow. Pregnant cows may abort. Surviving cattle convalesce over several weeks, during which hematologic parameters gradually return to normal.  Bos indicus breeds of cattle appear to possess a greater resistance to A marginale infection than B taurus breeds, but variation of resistance of individuals within breeds of both species occurs. Differences in virulence between Anaplasma strains and the level and duration of the rickettsemia also play a role in severity of clinical manifestations.  Lesions Lesions are typical of those found in animals with anemia due to erythrophagocytosis. The carcasses of cattle that die from anaplasmosis are generally markedly anemic and jaundiced. Blood is thin and watery. The spleen is characteristically enlarged and soft, with prominent follicles. The liver may be mottled and yellow-orange. The gallbladder is often distended and contains thick brown or green bile. Hepatic and mediastinal lymph nodes appear brown. There are serous effusions in body cavities, pulmonary edema, petechial hemorrhages in the epi- and endocardium, and often evidence of severe GI stasis. Widespread phagocytosis of erythrocytes is evident on microscopic examination of the reticuloendothelial organs. A significant proportion of erythrocytes are usually found to be parasitized after death due to acute infection.  Diagnosis of Anaplasmosis Diagnosis based on clinical signs, blood smears, and serologic testing  Anaplasma marginale, bovine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Ms. Sue Anderson, Tick Fever Centre, Wacol, Queensland, Australia.  A marginale, together with the hemoprotozoa Babesia bovis and B bigemina, are the causative agents of tick fever in cattle. These three species have similar geographic distributions, except that anaplasmosis occurs in the absence of babesiosis in the USA. Microscopic examination of Giemsa-stained thin and thick blood films is critical to distinguish anaplasmosis from babesiosis and other conditions that result in anemia and jaundice, such as leptospirosis and theileriosis. Blood in anticoagulant should also be obtained for hematologic testing. In Giemsa-stained thin blood films, Anaplasma spp appear as dense, homogeneously staining blue-purple inclusions 0.3–1 mcm in diameter. A marginale inclusions are usually located toward the margin of the infected erythrocyte, whereas A centrale inclusion bodies are located more centrally.  Inclusion bodies contain 1–8 initial bodies 0.3–0.4 mcm in diameter, which are the individual rickettsiae. The percentage of infected erythrocytes varies with the stage and severity of disease; maximum rickettsemias in excess of 50% can occur with A marginale. Microscopically, the infection becomes visible 2–6 weeks after transmission. During the course of infection, the rickettsemia can double each day for up to 10 days and then decreases. Severe anemia can persist for weeks after parasites cannot be detected in blood smears.  Chronically infected carriers may be identified with a fair degree of accuracy by serologic testing using the msp5 ELISA, complement fixation, or card agglutination tests. Nucleic acid-based detection methods are not always useful because these tests may not detect carrier levels.  At necropsy, thin blood films of liver, kidney, spleen, lungs, and peripheral blood should be prepared for microscopic examination.  Treatment, Control, and Prevention of Anaplasmosis Tetracyclines, imidocarb, and vaccination by inoculation with less pathogenic species  Tetracycline antibiotics and imidocarb are currently used for treatment. Infections may be completely cleared by treatment with these drugs and the cattle then remain immune to severe anaplasmosis for at least 8 months.  Prompt administration of tetracycline drugs (tetracycline, chlortetracycline, oxytetracycline, rolitetracycline, doxycycline, minocycline) in the early stages of acute disease (eg, PCV >15%) usually ensures survival. A commonly used treatment consists of a single IM injection of long-acting oxytetracycline at a dosage of 20 mg/kg. Blood transfusion to partially restore the PCV greatly improves the survival rate of more severely affected cattle. The carrier state may be eliminated by administration of a long-acting oxytetracycline preparation (20 mg/kg, IM, at least two injections with a 1-week interval). Withholding periods for tetracyclines apply in most countries. Injection into the neck muscle rather than the rump is preferred.  Imidocarb is also highly efficacious against A marginale as a single injection (as the dihydrochloride salt at 1.5 mg/kg, SC, or as imidocarb dipropionate at 3 mg/kg, SC). Elimination of the carrier state requires the use of higher repeated doses of imidocarb (eg, 5 mg/kg, IM or SC, two injections of the dihydrochloride salt 2 weeks apart). Imidocarb is a suspected carcinogen with long withholding periods and is not approved for use in the USA or Europe.  In South Africa, Australia, Israel, and South America, infection with live A centrale (originating from South Africa) has been used as a vaccine to provide cattle with partial protection against the disease caused by A marginale. In the USA, where live vaccines cannot be used, vaccines comprising nonliving A marginale purified from infected bovine erythrocytes and adjuvant have been used in the past but are no longer available. Long-lasting immunity against A marginale is conferred by preimmunization with live rickettsia, combined with the use of chemotherapy to control severe reactions. .Subunit vaccines to control bovine anaplasmosis are under investigation. In some areas, sustained stringent control or elimination of the arthropod vectors may be a viable control strategy; however, in other areas immunization is recommended.  Key Points Bovine anaplasmosis is endemic in many areas of the world and is transmitted by several tick vectors.  Certain countries use the less pathogenic Anaplasma centrale as a live vaccine, but it has not been used in North America.  Clinical signs include progressive anemia and fever with disease severity age-dependent, because cattle < 1 year old show no or mild clinical signs. Laboratory diagnosis is usually confirmed using stained blood smears and ELISA.  Outbreaks of bovine anaplasmosis are usually seasonal, and tetracyclines and imidocarb are effective treatments.  A ovis causes mild to severe disease in sheep, goats, and deer but is not infectious for cattle. Dogs and Cats Babesia spp have been reported in dogs from most geographic areas. These include B canis, B vogeli, and B rossi. Babesia canis is transmitted by Dermacentor reticularis in Europe, B vogeli by Rhipicephalus sanguineus in tropical and subtropical countries, and B rossi by Haemaphysalis elliptica in South Africa. Consequences of Babesia infection vary from a mild, transient illness to acute disease that rapidly results in death.  Babesia gibsoni is the other important Babesia of dogs and is a much smaller parasite. It has a more limited distribution and characteristically causes a chronic disease with progressive, severe anemia that is not readily treated with normal babesiacides.  Illness of varying severity due to B felis in domestic cats has mostly been reported in southern Africa, as well as B leo, and B lengau and less-well defined species. Sporadic cases associated with other Babesia species have been reported elsewhere. An unusual feature of B felis is its lack of response to the normal babesiacides.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Babesiosis in Animals The major economic impact of babesiosis is to the cattle industry in tropical and subtropical geographic areas, and is attributed to Babesia bovis and Babesia bigemina; however, the diseases caused by different Babesia have many common features. Babesiosis is a tickborne disease and its geographic distribution is therefore determined by the distribution of tick vectors. The main vectors of B bigemina and B bovis are 1-host Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) spp ticks which are widespread in tropical and subtropical areas. Transmission occurs transovarially. Although these Babesia spp can be readily transmitted experimentally by blood inoculation, mechanical transmission by insects or during surgical procedures has no practical importance. Intrauterine infection has also been reported but is rare.  In Rhipicephalus spp ticks, the blood stages of the parasite are ingested during engorgement and undergo sexual and asexual multiplication in the replete female, infecting eggs and subsequent parasitic stages. Transmission to the host occurs when larvae (in the case of B bovis) or nymphs and adults (in the case of B bigemina) feed. The percentage of larvae infected can vary from 0%–50% or higher, depending mainly on the level of parasitemia of the host at the time the female ticks engorge. Under field conditions, the rate of tick transmission is generally higher for B bigemina than for B bovis.  In endemic areas, three features are important in determining the risk of clinical disease in cattle:  Calves have a level of immunity (related both to colostral-derived antibodies and to age-specific factors) that persists for ~6–8 months, whereas older animals without immunity are susceptible to clinical disease.  Animals that recover from Babesia infections are generally immune for the typical productive lifespan of animals raised in commercial settings.  The susceptibility of cattle breeds to ticks and Babesia infections varies (eg, Bos indicus cattle tend to be more resistant to both ticks and the effects of B bovis and B bigemina infection than Bos taurus–derived breeds).  At high levels of tick transmission, virtually all calves become infected with Babesia by 6–8 months of age, show few if any clinical signs, become immune, and retain this immunity into their adult life. This situation can be altered by a reduction in tick numbers, either natural (eg, climatic) or artificial (eg, acaricide treatment or changing breed composition of herd). Low tick numbers may mean that there is insufficient transmission of Babesia to calves to ensure all are infected. Other circumstances that can lead to clinical outbreaks include the introduction of susceptible cattle to endemic areas and the incursion of Babesia-infected ticks into previously tick-free areas.  Major epizootics occurred in cattle in the US, Australia, and South Africa in the 19th century, associated with the movement of infected cattle and the tick vector. Some countries retain tick-free quarantine zones as a means of controlling the spread of the Rhipicephalus (Boophilus) tick vector.  Bovine babesiosis is an OIE-listed disease and included on the Voluntary 2021 U.S. National Animal Health Reporting System (NAHRS) Reportable Diseases, Infections, and Infestations List.  Zoonotic Risk Cases of babesiosis in humans have been reported. The rodent parasite B microti and the cattle parasite B divergens are the most commonly implicated species in North America and Europe, respectively. However, B duncani, B venatorum, and some less well-defined species have also been implicated. The reservoir hosts and vectors of some of these species are not necessarily known. Babesiosis infections in humans are acquired via bites from infected ticks or via contaminated blood from an infected transfusion donor. Cases reported in splenectomized or otherwise immunocompromised individuals are often fatal.  Clinical Findings of Babesiosis in Animals Acute babesiosis generally runs a course of ~1 week or less. The first clinical signs are lethargy, weakness, depression, and fever (frequently ≥106°F [41°C]), which persist throughout, and these are accompanied later by inappetence, anemia, jaundice, and weight loss; hemoglobinemia and hemoglobinuria occur in the final stages. Involvement of the CNS due to adhesion of parasitized erythrocytes in brain capillaries can occur with B bovis infections. Late-term pregnant cows may abort, and temporary infertility due to transient fever may occur in bulls. Many animals recover; however, some may die if not treated.  Animals that recover from the acute disease remain infected for a number of years with B bovis or for a few months with B bigemina. No clinical signs are apparent during this carrier state.  Postmortem Lesions Postmortem lesions (particularly with B bovis) include the following:  enlarged and friable spleen  swollen liver with an enlarged gallbladder containing thick granular bile  congested, dark-colored kidneys  generalized anemia and jaundice  Most clinical cases of B bigemina have hemoglobinuria; however, this is not invariably the case with B bovis. Other organs, including the brain and heart, may show congestion or petechiae.

Examination of Giemsa-stained blood or organ smears by light microscopy is essential to confirm the diagnosis. Light microscopy is rapid and inexpensive but does require some expertise. From the live animal, blood smears should be prepared from capillaries, for example from the ear or tail tip, to improve the sensitivity of detection of B bovis, because B bovis-infected erythrocytes adhere to capillary endothelium. Smears of brain, muscle, kidney, spleen, and from a blood vessel in an extremity should be taken at postmortem examination. Note that detection of Babesia spp using light microscopy in the carrier state has poor sensitivity.  Microscopically, the species of Babesia involved can be determined morphologically; however, expertise is required, especially in B bovis infections in which few organisms may be present. Babesia bovis is generally small, with the parasites in paired form at an obtuse angle to each other and measuring ~1–1.5 × 0.5–1 mcm. B bigemina is larger (3–3.5 × 1–1.5 mcm), with paired parasites lying almost parallel or at an acute angle to each other. Single forms of both parasites are also commonly seen.  Other Diagnostic Tests Molecular methods such as PCR assays are more sensitive than light microscopy and may be useful to detect Babesia spp in the carrier state or during chronic infection. Molecular methods are also used to differentiate and characterize isolates. Because of the persistence of the organisms in the blood, detection of the organisms does not necessarily indicate that they are the cause of the current disease or are having any health impact.  Serologic tests have been described for the detection of antibodies to Babesia spp in carrier animals. The most commonly used are the indirect fluorescent antibody test and ELISA. These are not useful for diagnosis in the acute stage of illness.  Subinoculation of blood (~500 mL) into a fully susceptible animal, preferably a splenectomized calf, and subsequent monitoring of the recipient for infection may occasionally be justified to confirm infection in suspected carrier animals.  Treatment, Control, and Prevention of Babesiosis in Animals Babesiacides  Supportive treatment  Tick control  Use of resistant breeds  Vaccination  Babesiacides A variety of babesiacidal drugs have been used to treat bovine babesiosis; however, only diminazene aceturate and imidocarb dipropionate are still in common use. These drugs are not available in all endemic countries, or their use may be restricted. Manufacturers' recommendations for use should be followed. For treating cattle, diminazene is administered at 3.5 mg/kg, IM, once. For treatment, imidocarb is administered at 1.2 mg/kg, SC, once. At a dosage of 3 mg/kg, imidocarb provides protection from babesiosis for approximately 4 weeks and may also eliminate B bovis and B bigemina from carrier animals.  Supportive Treatment Supportive treatment is advisable, particularly in valuable animals, and may include the use of anti-inflammatory drugs, corticosteroids, and fluid therapy. Blood transfusions may be lifesaving in very anemic animals.  Tick Control Tick control, via acaricides or management practices, can be useful in reducing tick burdens, which can lower transmission rates. However, this can lead to naive cattle populations, with consequent risk of outbreaks of disease should tick populations increase. Chemical tick control cannot be relied upon to prevent transmission of Babesia, and outbreaks often occur after introduction of susceptible cattle to endemic areas despite acaricide use. Acaricide resistance is also an increasing problem. However, acaricidal tick control before moving animals from tick-infested areas is useful to prevent the introduction of ticks and babesiosis to tick-free areas.  Eradication of the tick vector is rarely feasible on individual premises but may work on a regional level in well-coordinated programs.  Using Resistant Breeds Bos indicus–based breeds are commonly used to minimize production losses associated with ticks and babesiosis.  Vaccination Vaccination using live attenuated strains of the Babesia parasites has been used successfully in countries such as Argentina, Australia, Brazil, Israel, South Africa, and Uruguay. The vaccine is available in either a chilled or frozen form. One vaccination produces adequate immunity for the typical productive lifespan of animals raised in commercial settings. Commercial vaccines based on recombinant antigens are not yet available.  Key Points Hemotropic Mycoplasma Infections in Animals (Hemoplasmas) ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Hemoplasmas are bacteria in the genus Mycoplasma that lack cell walls and attach to erythrocytes of target hosts, potentially causing host immune-based anemia. Many infections are asymptomatic. Diagnosis can be based on microscopy or PCR. Antibiotics and supportive care are the usual treatments. Transmission | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Zoonotic Risk | Feline Infectious Anemia | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (4) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Hemoplasmas, or hemotropic mycoplasmas, are epierythrocytic parasites within the order Mycoplasmatales. Modern taxonomy provisionally accepts that the genus Mycoplasma now contains genera previously known as Haemobartonella and Eperythrozoon based on hemoplasmas' lack of a cell wall, use of the codon UGA to encode tryptophan, and 16S rRNA gene sequences. Those species for which full characterization based on bacterial culture is lacking are given the designation \"Candidatus.\"  Hemoplasmas infect a wide variety of vertebrates throughout the world, including several reported to infect human beings. They have morphologic features such as rod, coccoid, and ring-shaped structures found individually or in chains on the red cell, and they stain gram-negative because of the lack of a cell wall. None of the hemoplasmas have been cultured in vitro. Hemoplasmas attach to the surface of the host's red cells and may, under certain conditions, penetrate the cell.  Several hemoplasmas are of veterinary importance ( see Table: Hemoplasmas of Veterinary Importance). In addition to varying host tropism, these organisms vary in their ability to cause clinically significant hemolytic anemia.  Table Hemoplasmas of Veterinary Importance Transmission of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Hemoplasmas may be transmitted by transfer of infected blood (blood transfusion or use of contaminated needles, surgical instruments, or herd or flock management equipment) or via arthropod vectors such as lice, flies, ticks, and mosquitoes. Vertical transmission from mother to offspring has been reported in cats, swine, and camelids. Direct transmission, possibly associated with fighting, is suspected in cats and supported by studies reporting presence of hemoplasma DNA in saliva, on gingiva, and on claw beds of infected cats.  Clinical Findings of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Hemoplasmas can cause hemolytic anemia, but the severity varies greatly. Most animals develop asymptomatic infections, with more severe, acute anemias associated with certain hemoplasma strains, splenectomy, immunocompromise, concurrent infection (such as with feline leukemia virus or feline immunodeficiency virus in cats), or coinfection with multiple hemoplasma species. Notably, M haemofelis causes acute, potentially severe or fatal hemolytic anemia in healthy cats. Typical clinical signs include lethargy, anorexia, and fever, with splenomegaly and icterus occurring less often.  M haemocanis causes acute hemolysis in dogs that are splenectomized, but infections are usually asymptomatic in healthy dogs.  M suis causes hemolytic anemia accompanied by icterus in neonatal pigs, feeder pigs, and pregnant sows. Chronic infection is associated with poor growth rates, decreased conception rates, reproductive failure, and decreased milk production.  M wenyonii infection in cattle is usually asymptomatic, but a syndrome of mammary gland and hindlimb edema, decreased milk production, fever, and lymphadenopathy has been described in young, nonanemic, primiparous heifers. Infection in young bulls has been reported to cause scrotal and hindlimb edema.  M ovis infection in sheep and goats is often asymptomatic, but hemolytic anemia can occur in young animals, especially those with heavy intestinal worm burdens. Chronic infection may result in poor weight gain, exercise intolerance, decreased wool production, and mild anemia.  Hemoplasma infection in camelids can cause a severe hemolytic anemia in young crias.  The prevalence of chronic infection in sheep, pigs, and kennel-raised dogs is high, and outbreaks of acute disease have been reported in animals during research studies. Presence of hemoplasma infection may affect experimental results and lead to misinterpretation of data.  The hemolysis caused by hemoplasma infections is immune-mediated and typically extravascular, resulting in a regenerative anemia. Erythrocyte agglutination may be present, and Coombs’ test results are often positive in cats infected with M haemofelis. Splenectomized dogs with acute hemolysis due to M haemocanis may have agglutination, spherocytosis, and a positive Coombs’ test. Hypoglycemia secondary to glucose consumption by the bacteria has been reported in heavily parasitized pigs, sheep, llamas, and calves; however, rapid bacterial glycolysis in vitro may also cause artifactually decreased blood glucose concentrations.  Diagnosis of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Microscopy or PCR  Historically, diagnosis of hemoplasmas has been made based on detection of organisms on routine Wright-stained blood smears, on which they appear as small (0.5–3 mcm), basophilic, round, rod, or ring-shaped structures present on erythrocytes individually or in chains, or sometimes seen free in the background. However, sensitivity of the blood smear may be poor, because parasitemia in chronic infections can be cyclic, and organisms can disappear from circulation in as little as 2 hours. Hemoplasmas dissociate from erythrocytes and die after a variable amount of time in EDTA, hampering detection of organisms in aged samples. Specificity of the test is also poor if there are few organisms and if characteristic morphology isn't present to differentiate from stain artifact or other nonpathogenic structures.

Mycoplasma (Eperythrozoon) suis, porcine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. Bruce Lawhorn.  PCR assays capable of discriminating among hemoplasmas have greatly enhanced diagnosis of these parasites and has led to identification of several new Mycoplasma species. PCR can be run on whole blood and aspirates of the spleen.  Treatment and Control of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas in Animals Antimicrobial and supportive treatment  For acute hemoplasma infections, tetracyclines (doxycycline, oxytetracycline) are the mainstay of treatment; pradofloxacin and marbofloxacin have also been effective against M haemofelis. Glucocorticoids may be useful to decrease erythrophagocytosis in cases of severe hemolysis because the primary mechanism of damage is immune-mediated targeting of infected host cells. Some animals may require blood transfusion, but animals must be carefully monitored because the parasite can rapidly infect transfused cells as well. Treated animals may remain carriers and may experience periodic clinical relapses with reemerging parasitemia if the animal is stressed or immunocompromised.  Once an initial infection is controlled, either naturally or after antibiotic treatment, protective immunity develops against repeat M haemofelis infection; how long this immunity will last and whether this applies to other hemoplasma infections is unknown.  Blood donors should be screened using PCR-based DNA assays to prevent transmission to transfusion recipients. Iatrogenic transmission can be avoided by using properly sterilized needles and equipment. Control of arthropod vectors is recommended, as is minimizing stress in managing herds and flocks.  Zoonotic Risk of Hemotropic Mycoplasmas Hemoplasma infections are typically species specific, except for M ovis, which infects both sheep and goats, and \"Candidatus M haemolamae,\" which infects both llamas and alpacas. There are reports of human eperythrozoonosis from Inner Mongolia, China, but supporting evidence is not compelling. There have also been rare reports of hemoplasma infections in immunocompromised people in which molecular methods were used for confirmation. One report documented an HIV-positive human patient coinfected with Bartonella henselae and a hemoplasma genetically similar to M haemofelis. This individual owned five cats and had multiple scratch and bite wounds. All five cats were PCR positive for Bartonella spp and two were positive for M haemofelis, suggesting the possibility of zoonotic transmission. The coinfection of a veterinarian in Texas with B henselae and M ovis also has been reported.  Feline Infectious Anemia (Hemoplasmosis) In cats, hemotropic mycoplasmosis can produce a disease called feline infectious anemia (FIA), previously known as hemobartonellosis. M haemofelis (previously the Ohio strain, or large form, of Haemobartonella felis) is the most pathogenic organism causing FIA, and it can cause hemolytic anemia in immunocompetent cats. \"Candidatus M haemominutum\" (previously the California strain, or small form, of H felis) is the most common hemoplasma in cat populations worldwide, but it has not been clearly associated with disease in immunocompetent cats. \"Candidatus M turicensis\" has never been seen on blood smears, and its pathogenicity is not well understood. Both Candidatus species may be capable of inducing anemia in cats with underlying immunosuppressive disease, such as feline leukemia virus infection.  In the case of M haemofelis infection, an incubation period of 2–30 days is followed by anemia, with some cats developing cyclical changes in PCV that coincide with the appearance of large numbers of organisms on blood smears. In untreated cats, this acute phase lasts for 3–4 weeks, after which some cats may remain chronically infected despite normal or near normal PCV values. It has been suggested that recrudescence of anemia may occur when these chronically infected cats are subject to debilitating disease, stress, or immunosuppressive therapies.  Any anemic cat, especially one with an anemia showing evidence of regeneration (polychromasia and/or reticulocytosis), may be suspected of having FIA. The severity of clinical signs correlates with the rapidity of onset of anemia. Clinical findings include weakness, pallor of the mucous membranes, tachypnea, tachycardia, and occasionally collapse. Acutely ill cats may be febrile, and moribund cats may be hypothermic. Other physical examination abnormalities may include cardiac murmurs, splenomegaly, and icterus. In chronic or slowly developing cases, there may be normal or subnormal body temperature, weakness, depression, and weight loss or emaciation.  Expected laboratory abnormalities include a moderate to marked regenerative anemia, increased numbers of nucleated RBCs, polychromasia, anisocytosis, Howell-Jolly bodies, and an increased reticulocyte count. Coombs’ tests can become positive 7–14 days after organisms appear in the blood and remain positive throughout the acute phase, reverting to negative in chronically infected carrier cats.  Haemobartonella felis, feline blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. John W. Harvey.  Laboratory confirmation has traditionally been based on identification of organisms in the peripheral blood using light microscopy, although M haemofelis is visible < 50% of the time in acutely infected cats. PCR assays are available in many laboratories and are considerably more sensitive and specific than blood-smear evaluation.  Without treatment, one third of acutely ill cats may die. Treatment involves supportive therapies, such as oxygen and blood transfusions, as well as specific therapy with doxycycline (10 mg/kg/day, PO, for a minimum of 2 weeks). Because of the potential for esophagitis and esophageal strictures, administration of doxycycline hyclate preparations should be followed by administration of a bolus of several milliliters of water. Either marbofloxacin or pradofloxacin is a suitable alternative to doxycycline. Treatment of PCR-positive, healthy cats is currently not recommended, because no regimen has yet been identified that completely eliminates the organism. Immunosuppressive dosages of glucocorticoids to suppress immune-mediated RBC injury may be used in cats that do not respond to antimicrobial therapy alone, or when primary immune-mediated hemolytic anemia is a possible cause.  Key Points Hemoplasmas are bacteria in the genus Mycoplasma that infect RBCs of several species of animals.  Infection is often asymptomatic but can be diagnosed by microscopy or PCR.  Treatments include antibiotics and supportive care. Old World Hepatozoonosis and American Canine Hepatozoonosis ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Disease associated with Hepatozoon canis infection, or Old World Hepatozoonosis, ranges from subclinical and chronic to severe and life-threatening. Clinical signs include fever, lethargy, anorexia, and anemia. H americanum is the causative agent of American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), a condition which is most commonly severe to fatal, with salient clinical features including fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, muscle atrophy, muscle and bone pain, lameness, and recumbency. H canis is typically diagnosed by observation of parasites within leukocytes or by PCR. Infections are most commonly treated with imidocarb dipropionate for 2–3 months. ACH infections may be diagnosed by clinical signs, PCR, observation of parasites or associated lesions in muscle biopsies, and radiographs. Treatment is with antibiotics and NSAIDs for 2 weeks, followed by daily decoquinate for at least 2 years. Etiology, Epidemiology, and Transmission | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (0) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Etiology, Epidemiology, and Transmission of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Old World hepatozoonosis is a tick-borne disease of wild and domestic canids caused by the protozoal agent Hepatozoon canis. The organism is transmitted by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus. In North America, Hepatozoon americanum, causative agent of American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH) is transmitted by the Gulf Coast tick, Amblyomma maculatum, rather than by the brown dog tick. H canis and H americanum, although closely related, result in clinically distinct syndromes in infected dogs, and genetic and antigenic differences between the organisms further support their classification as distinct species.  H canis is reported in many regions of the world, including Asia, Africa, the Caribbean islands, Europe, and South America. Before 2008, H canis was not thought to infect canids in North America, despite the presence of R sanguineus, but molecular evidence has since emerged that suggests otherwise. Still, ACH remains the more common and severe form of canine hepatozoonosis in the United States. American canine hepatozoonosis is an emerging disease that has primarily spread north and east from the Gulf coast of Texas, where it was originally detected in 1978. The distribution of this parasite chiefly parallels the distribution of the Gulf coast tick, although sporadic cases have been reported from disparate geographic locations presumably due to travel history. The associated table indicates states in which H canis, H americanum, and concomitant H canis and H americanum infections have been reported in domestic dogs.  Table States in which H canis and H americanum infections in domestic dogs have been documented The mode of transmission of hepatozoonosis is not typical in the classical sense of a tickborne disease; like other species in the genus, H canis and H americanum infections occur when infected ticks, the definitive host, are ingested by canine hosts. Sporozoites released from the mature oocysts in the ticks' hemocoel enter canine hosts via the gut. Dogs can also develop ACH after eating paratenic (transport) hosts that contain cystozoites, a resting stage of H americanum encysted within tissues.  In general, immunocompetent dogs appear to tolerate infection with H canis very well. Although life-threatening infections have been reported, clinical signs associated with H canis infection are most often subclinical to mild. H americanum, however, causes severe clinical signs in most infected dogs, with death often occurring within 1–2 years without supportive therapies; immunosuppression or concurrent disease does not appear necessary to induce the severe syndrome.  Clinical Findings of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs H canis tissue stages reside within bone marrow, lymph nodes, and spleen, and unlike ACH patients, dogs infected with the Old World parasite do not appear to be in pain at presentation; in dogs with overt disease, nonspecific clinical signs including fever, lethargy, depression, and anemia may be observed.  The tissue phases of H americanum induce pyogranulomatous inflammation, which results in clinical signs including fever, depression, weight loss, poor body condition, muscle atrophy, pain, and weakness; mucopurulent ocular discharge is common, and bloody diarrhea occurs occasionally. Fever, which may fluctuate with the waxing and waning of clinical signs, ranges from 102.7°–106°F (39.3°–41°C) and is unresponsive to antibiotics. Surprisingly, many dogs maintain a normal appetite if food is placed directly in front of them, but they often will not move to eat, apparently because of intense pain. Hyperesthesia, presumably due to severe inflammation within muscle and sometimes along bone, manifests as stiffness and reluctance to move, as well as cervical and/or truncal rigidity. Longterm sequelae include glomerulonephritis and amyloidosis.  Diagnosis of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Clinical evaluation and patient history  CBC and biochemistry panel  Cytology  PCR  Muscle biopsy and histologic evaluation  Bone radiography  Patient history of tick exposure, travel, and, in suspected ACH cases, predation on rodents or rabbits, are important factors to consider when forming a potential diagnosis of canine hepatozoonosis, in conjunction with clinical examination and laboratory testing. The most common abnormality on blood work in dogs infected with H canis is anemia. Serum chemistry abnormalities may include increased CK and alkaline phosphatase (AP) activities as well as hypoproteinemia with polyclonal hyperglobulinemia and hypoalbuminemia. Parasitemia in dogs with clinical H canis infection is often quite high, and a diagnosis can readily be achieved by microscopic examination of Romanowsky-type stained blood films to visualize parasite-containing leukocytes or by PCR to detect parasite DNA in peripheral blood. Hepatitis, pneumonia, and glomerulonephritis associated with H canis tissue stages have been reported postmortem in some animals with extremely high parasitemia.  In dogs with ACH, the most consistent laboratory abnormality is a neutrophilic leukocytosis, with counts ranging from 20,000–200,000 cells/μL. This is typically a pronounced, mature neutrophilia, although a left shift may be present. A mild to moderate anemia is also common. The platelet count is typically normal to high. Serum chemistry abnormalities in ACH patients are similar to those occasionally observed in H canis patients. Definitive diagnosis of ACH in suspicious patients is made by finding rare gamonts in peripheral blood leukocytes, by occasional PCR detection of circulating parasite, or by identifying pathognomonic \"onion skin\" cysts or pyogranulomas in stained sections of biopsied muscle.  Although invasive, muscle biopsy is considered the gold standard for diagnosing ACH, because parasites and associated lesions are often extensively distributed throughout muscle tissue (especially in areas with observable atrophy); multiple or sequential biopsies may be necessary in some animals.  Radiographs in ACH patients may show periosteal reactions involving any bone, including the skull and vertebrae. The lesions resemble those of hypertrophic osteopathy except that they tend to be proximal rather than distal, and often markedly obvious in long bones; the physiologic basis for bony proliferation animals with H americanum infection is unknown.  No commercially available serologic assays have been developed to detect canine hepatozoonosis infection. PCR methods detecting circulating Hepatozoon spp are available through several academic institutions, although the assays may lack sensitivity in diagnosing H americanum infections because of the typically low levels of parasitemia in ACH patients. Use of these molecular tests has revealed that hepatazoonosis caused by H canis is more common in North America than previously known.  Treatment of Hepatozoonosis in Dogs Antiprotozoal therapy  Supportive care  Tick control products  Preventing predation  Hepatozoonosis is generally considered a lifelong infection in dogs. No known therapeutic regimen completely clears animals of the organisms. H canis infections are treated with imidocarb dipropionate, twice monthly, at 5–6 mg/kg, SC, until the parasite is no longer evident in blood smears for 2–3 consecutive months. Prognosis often depends on the degree of parasitemia; dogs with low parasitemia typically respond well to treatment, whereas those with high parasitemia may not, especially if afflicted by concurrent illness.  Remission of clinical signs associated with H americanum infection can usually be achieved through a 14-day course of combination therapy, referred to as TCP, which consists of trimethoprim-sulfadiazine (15 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours), clindamycin (10 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours), and pyrimethamine (0.25 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours), or ponazuril (10 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours). Remission with these therapies alone is often temporary, with many dogs relapsing within 2–6 months. Decoquinate mixed in food at a dose of 10−20 mg/kg is given every 12 hours as an adjunct therapy to initial TCP or ponazuril treatment for at least 2 years to help prevent relapse. NSAIDs may be the best treatment for control of fever and pain, especially during the first few days of TCP or ponazuril therapy. Glucocorticoid administration should be avoided because, although steroids may provide temporary relief, longterm use can exacerbate disease.  Preventing access to ticks and discouraging predation are the most effective forms of control for hepatozoonosis. Predation presents a dual risk for acquiring ACH: prey captured or eaten by dogs could have infected ticks on their coats that would provide a source of sporozoites; additionally, the prey could contain cystozoites (at least in the case of H americanum) that are also infectious. Additionally, dogs diagnosed with hepatozoonosis should not be bred because transplacental transmission of H canis has been documented. Although vertical transmission of H americanum has not been reported, it may be possible.  There is no known zoonotic risk with hepatozoonosis.  Key Points Canine hepatozoonosis is caused by H canis and H americanum, which are tick-borne protozoan parasites causing distinct clinical manifestations in canine patients after infected ticks are ingested.  H canis infection often leads to mild to moderate clinical disease, with anemia in some cases, whereas H americanum infection often results in a severe clinical syndrome known as American canine hepatozoonosis (ACH), with patients commonly exhibiting fever, mucopurulent ocular discharge, intense pain, muscle atrophy, and elevated neutrophil counts.  Diagnosis of canine hepatozoonosis is often based on patient history, clinical signs, blood work and cytology, PCR of peripheral blood, and in the case of ACH, characteristic histopathologic lesions evident in biopsied muscle tissue.  H canis infections are treated with imidocarb dipropionate (5−6 mg/kg, SC) 2 times monthly for 2−3 consecutive months, whereas H americanum infections are treated with a 14-day combination antibiotic therapy (trimethoprim-sulfadiazine at 15 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours; clindamycin at 10 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours; and pyrimethamine at 0.25 mg/kg, PO, every 24 hours) or ponazuril (10 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours) followed by long-term decoquinate administration (10−20 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours, mixed in food); tick control products are recommended to help prevent infection.  Treatment regimens recommended for canine hepatozoonosis are not curative, and prognoses are considered guarded, especially for ACH patients. Clinical signs often abate with treatment and animals return to having a good quality of life. Trypanosomiasis in Animals ByAlicja E. Tabor, BSc, PhD, Centre for Animal Science, Queensland Alliance for Agriculture and Food Innovation, The University of Queensland Reviewed/Revised Mar 2022 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomiasis | Transmission and Epidemiology | Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings and Lesions | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Surra | Dourine | Chagas Disease | Transmission and Epidemiology | Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings and Lesions | Diagnosis | Treatment and Control | Nonpathogenic Trypanosomes | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (1) Tables (2) Videos (0) Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomiasis Tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis refers to a group of diseases caused by protozoa of the genus Trypanosoma and affects all domesticated animals. The major veterinary species are T congolense, T vivax, T brucei brucei, and T simiae. T brucei rhodesiense and T brucei gambiense are zoonotic, with people as the predominant host. For the animals mainly affected by these tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes and the geographic areas where tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis occurs, see Table: Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomes.  Table Tsetse-transmitted Trypanosomes Cattle, sheep, and goats are infected, in order of importance, by T congolense, T vivax, and T brucei brucei. In pigs, T simiae is the most important. In dogs and cats, T brucei is probably the most important. It is difficult to assign an order of importance for horses and camels. T vivax is found outside tsetse-infested areas of sub-Saharan Africa, carried mechanically by biting flies.  The trypanosomes that cause tsetse-transmitted trypanosomiasis (sleeping sickness) in people, T brucei rhodesiense and T brucei gambiense, closely resemble T brucei brucei, and suitable precautions should be taken when working with such isolates. Domestic animals act as reservoirs of human infections.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Most tsetse transmission is cyclic and begins when blood from a trypanosome-infected animal is ingested by the fly. The trypanosome alters its surface coat, multiplies in the fly, then alters its surface coat again, and becomes infective. T brucei spp migrate within the tsetse from the gut and eventually to the salivary glands; the cycle for T congolense stops at the hypopharynx, and the salivary glands are not invaded; the entire cycle for T vivax occurs in the proboscis. Therefore, the location within the tsetse can be useful in identifying the parasite species. The animal-infective form in the tsetse salivary gland is referred to as the metacyclic form. The life cycle in the tsetse may be as short as 1 week with T vivax or extend to a few weeks for T brucei spp.  Tsetse flies (genus Glossina) are restricted to Africa from about latitude 15°N to 29°S. The 3 main species inhabit relatively distinct environments: G morsitans usually is found in savanna country, G palpalis prefers areas around rivers and lakes, and G fusca lives in high forest areas. All 3 species transmit trypanosomes, and all feed on various mammals.  Mechanical transmission can occur through tsetse or other biting flies. In the case of T vivax, Tabanus spp and other biting flies seem to be the primary mechanical vectors outside tsetse-endemic areas, as in Central and South America. Mechanical transmission requires only that blood containing infectious trypanosomes be transferred by bite from one animal to another.  Pathogenesis of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Infected tsetse inoculate metacyclic trypanosomes into the skin of animals, where the trypanosomes reside for a few days and cause localized inflammation (chancres). They enter the lymph and lymph nodes, then the bloodstream, where they divide rapidly by binary fission. In T congolense infection, the organisms attach to endothelial cells and localize in capillaries and small blood vessels. T brucei species and T vivax invade tissues and cause tissue damage in several organs.  The immune response is vigorous, and immune complexes cause inflammation, which contributes to fever and other signs and lesions of the disease. Antibodies against the surface-coat glycoproteins kill the trypanosomes. However, trypanosomes have a large family of genes that code for variable surface-coat glycoproteins that are switched in response to the antibody response, evading immunity. This antigenic variation results in persistence of the organism. Antigenic variation has prevented development of a protective vaccine and permits reinfections when animals are exposed to a new antigenic type.  Clinical Findings and Lesions of Trypanosomiasis in Animals The severity of trypanosomiasis varies with species and age of the animal infected and species of trypanosome involved. The incubation period is usually 1–4 weeks. The primary clinical signs are intermittent fever, anemia, and weight loss. Cattle usually have a chronic course with high mortality, especially if there is poor nutrition or other stress factors. Ruminants may gradually recover if the number of infected tsetse flies is low; however, stress results in relapse.  Necropsy findings vary and are nonspecific. In acute, fatal cases, extensive petechiation of the serosal membranes, especially in the peritoneal cavity, may occur. Also, the lymph nodes and spleen are usually swollen. In chronic cases, swollen lymph nodes, serous atrophy of fat, and anemia are seen.  Diagnosis of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Clinical evaluation  Serologic testing  Trypanosoma vivax, bovine blood smear   Image Courtesy of Dr. Corrie Brown.  A presumptive diagnosis of trypanosomiasis is based on finding an anemic animal in poor condition in an endemic area. Confirmation depends on demonstrating trypanosomes in stained blood smears or wet mounts. The most sensitive rapid method is to examine a wet mount of the buffy coat area of a PCV tube after centrifugation, looking for motile parasites. Other infections that cause anemia and weight loss, such as babesiosis, anaplasmosis, theileriosis, and haemonchosis, should be excluded by examining a stained blood smear.  Various serologic tests measure antibody to trypanosomes, but their use is more suitable for herd and area screening than for individual diagnosis. Rapid agglutination tests to detect circulating trypanosome species-specific antigens in peripheral blood are available for both individual and herd diagnosis, although their reliability remains varied. Molecular techniques for trypanosome detection and differentiation have been developed, but they are not generally available for routine field use.  Treatment and Control of Trypanosomiasis in Animals Chemotherapeutics  Reduction of tsetse fly populations  Several drugs can be used for treatment ( see Table: Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals) of trypanosomiasis. Most have a narrow therapeutic index, which makes administration of the correct dose essential. Drug resistance occurs and should be considered in refractory cases.  Table Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals Control of trypanosomiasis can be exercised at several levels, including eradication of tsetse flies and use of prophylactic drugs. Tsetse flies can be partially controlled by frequent spraying and dipping of animals, aerial and ground spraying of insecticides on fly-breeding areas, use of insecticide-impregnated screens and targets, bush clearing, and other habitat removal methods. The Sterile Insect Technique (SIT) has been used with success in Zanzibar and may be used in other area-wide control operations after suppression of tsetse populations by insecticides. There is renewed international interest in large-scale tsetse eradication through the Pan African Tsetse and Trypanosomiasis Eradication Campaign (PATTEC) supported by the African Union. Animals can be given drugs prophylactically in areas with a high population of trypanosome-infected tsetse. Drug resistance must be carefully monitored by frequent blood examinations for trypanosomes in treated animals.  Several breeds of cattle and water buffalo have been identified that have innate resistance to trypanosomiasis and could play a valuable role in reducing the impact of the disease in these areas. However, resistance may be lost because of poor nutrition or heavy tsetse challenge.  Control is ideally achieved by combining methods to reduce the tsetse challenge and by enhancing host resistance with prophylactic drugs.  Surra (Trypanosoma evansi Infection) Surra is usually transmitted by other biting flies that are found within and outside tsetse fly areas. It is found in North Africa, the Middle East, Asia, the Far East, and Central and South America. The distribution of T evansi in Africa extends into the tsetse areas, where differentiation from T brucei is difficult. It is essentially a disease of camels and horses, but all domestic animals are susceptible. The disease can be fatal, particularly in camels, horses, and dogs. T evansi in other animals appears to be nonpathogenic, and these animals serve as reservoirs of infection.  Transmission is primarily by biting flies, probably resulting from interrupted feedings. A few wild animals are susceptible to infection and may serve as reservoirs.  Pathogenesis, clinical findings, lesions, diagnosis, and treatment for surra are similar to those of the tsetse-transmitted trypanosomes.  Dourine Dourine is a chronic venereal disease of horses that is transmitted during coitus and caused by T equiperdum. The disease is recognized on the Mediterranean coast of Africa and in the Middle East, southern Africa, and South America; distribution is probably wider.  Signs of dourine may develop over weeks or months. Early signs include mucopurulent discharge from the urethra in stallions and from the vagina in mares, followed by gross edema of the genitalia. Later, characteristic plaques 2–10 cm in diameter appear on the skin, and the horse becomes progressively emaciated. Mortality in untreated cases is 50%–70%.  Demonstration of trypanosomes from urethral or vaginal discharges, skin plaques, or peripheral blood is difficult unless the material is centrifuged. Infected horses can be detected with the complement fixation test but only in areas where T evansi or T brucei are not found because they have common antigens. An ELISA test may become available for diagnosis.  In endemic areas, horses may be treated ( see Table: Drugs Commonly Used for Trypanosomiasis in Domestic Animals). When eradication is required, strict control of breeding and elimination of stray horses has been successful. Alternatively, infected horses may be identified using the complement fixation test; euthanasia is mandatory.  Chagas Disease (Trypanosoma cruzi Infection) Chagas disease, or American trypanosomiasis, is a zoonotic, vector-borne disease transmitted by triatomine bugs and caused by T cruzi. All mammals are considered susceptible to infection, with infection demonstrated in >100 mammalian species. Avian species are not susceptible. The disease is best recognized in dogs and people, with dogs serving as a major domestic reservoir. Domestic pigs and cats can also be infected, but their role as reservoirs for human infection is limited. Wildlife reservoirs include opossums, armadillos, raccoons, woodrats, and nonhuman primates.  Transmission and Epidemiology of Chagas Disease in Animals Chagas disease is endemic in 21 countries of South America, Central America, and Mexico, and is increasingly reported in the southern USA. Chagas was once confined to the Americas, but human and animal migration has resulted in distribution to Europe, where it is an emerging disease of Spain, Switzerland, France, Italy, Germany, and England. Seropositivity in dogs in endemic regions can vary from 5%–92%. In some areas such as Venezuela, the seropositivity of dogs is similar to that of people, whereas in other areas, such as Campeche, Mexico, seropositivity can be higher in dogs than in people.  The nocturnal and hematophagous triatomine insects of the Triatoma, Rhodnius, and Panstrongylus genera serve as vectors for T cruzi. Common names include the “kissing bug,” “assassin bug,” “cone-nosed bug,” “vinchuca,” “chinche,” and “barbeiro.\" There are >130 species of triatomines in the Americas, and most are considered competent vectors. Insects take an infected blood meal ingesting extracellular T cruzi trypomastigotes. These differentiate in the midgut to epimastigotes and divide. Epimastigotes travel to the hindgut, where they differentiate back into metacyclic trypomastigotes. Infective metacyclic trypomastigotes are shed in insect feces.  In insectivorous animals, including dogs, consumption of infected bugs or materials contaminated with infected triatomine feces is a major mode of transmission. Remarkably, the opossum (Didelphis species) is a unique host for T cruzi, because the parasite can complete its entire life cycle without the need for a vector. T cruzi maturation occurs in the anal odoriferous glands, and infective trypomastigotes can be shed in feces or urine and ingested. Additional methods of transmission include transplacentally or via blood transfusions and organ transplant.  Pathogenesis of Chagas Disease in Animals Once metacyclic trypomastigotes enter the bloodstream, they actively invade many cell types, exiting the parasitophorous vacuole and becoming nonflagellated amastigotes. Intracellular amastigotes divide every 15–18 hours for 5–6 days. T cruzi transforms back into trypomastigotes and lyses the cell. Released trypomastigotes invade new cells. T cruzi has a tropism for cardiac and smooth muscle but can be found in numerous other tissues.  Clinical Findings and Lesions of Chagas Disease in Animals Chagas disease is divided into acute and chronic phases, with the chronic phase further subdivided into latent and symptomatic chronic disease. Incubation ranges from 5–42 days before acute disease. Acute infections may be asymptomatic or consist of nonspecific febrile illness with a chancre at the site of parasitic entry. Dogs may also present with regional or generalized lymphadenopathy, anorexia, lethargy, vomiting, diarrhea, and hepatomegaly or splenomegaly. Rarely, acute clinical myocarditis is seen. Parasitemia peaks 2–3 weeks after infection and dissipates after the first month as the organism moves to predominantly tissue-borne disease.  The latent phase can last for months to years. Chronic disease symptoms can include generalized weakness or sudden death. Symptomatic dogs commonly present with right-side congestive heart failure. This can progress to myocarditis, with arrhythmias and bilateral cardiac dilation. Histologic examination of cardiac muscle may contain unruptured pseudocysts without inflammation or contain ruptured pseudocysts with lymphocytic, monocytic, and/or neutrophilic inflammation. Death secondary to heart failure is common.  Diagnosis of Chagas Disease in Animals Direct examination of blood smear  Antibody testing  Diagnosis of Chagas disease can be made by visualization of the organism, detection of DNA, or antibody detection. Parasitemia during the acute phase allows for detection on a microscopy of a routine peripheral blood smear. Although samples can be tested for T cruzi DNA by PCR or cultured, these diagnostic tests are uncommon in the field. On Giemsa stain, T cruzi is an extracellular, C-shaped protozoan with a single flagellum.  Antibody testing is of primary importance during the chronic phase. Whole blood, plasma, or serum can be submitted. Testing methodologies include immunochromographic “dipstick,” immunofluorescent antibody, or ELISA. Notably, cross-reaction with antibodies to Leishmania species, another trypanosomatid, can occur. Because of cross-reactivity of serologic tests, testing with at least two different methodologies or antigens is recommended. Additionally, cardiac tissue in the chronic phase can be analyzed by PCR for T cruzi DNA or by immunohistochemical analysis for amastigotes.  Treatment and Control of Chagas Disease in Animals Chemotherapeutics  Vector control  Benznidazole is the drug of choice for treatment for Chagas disease, but nifurtimox can also be used. In dogs, benznidazole is administered at 5–10 mg/kg/day, PO, for 2 months. In the USA, both of these drugs lack FDA approval, and their use requires permission from the CDC as investigational protocols. Symptomatic treatment for heart failure and arrhythmias is also recommended.  No vaccine for Chagas disease is available; thus, control focuses on preventing disease transmission. Vector control methods include applying pesticides to eliminate triatomine vectors and decreasing vector attraction to dwellings at night by turning off outdoor lighting. Breeding of positive bitches is discouraged. Screening of blood donors is recommended. To avoid iatrogenic transmission, disinfection with 10% bleach or 70% ethanol is suggested for contaminated surfaces. Dead infected insects can remain a source of infective T cruzi for up to 6 days at 10°C or up to 2 months at 26°–30°C.  Nonpathogenic Trypanosomes Trypanosoma theileri or markedly similar trypanosomes have been detected in peripheral blood from cattle on every continent. Infection with similar trypanosomes also has been detected in domestic and wild buffalo and various other wild ungulates. In the few areas studied, transmission is by contamination after a cycle of development in species of tabanid flies. Although most parasitemias are subpatent, the trypanosomes may be seen in a blood smear being examined for pathogenic protozoa or in a hemocytometer chamber. Pathogenicity has never been proved experimentally.  T melophagium of sheep also has a worldwide distribution and is transmitted by the sheep ked. T theodori, reported in goats, may be a synonym for the same trypanosome. Lymphoma in Dogs (Canine Lymphoma, Lymphosarcoma in Dogs) ByTimothy M. Fan, DVM, PhD, DACVIM, Department of Veterinary Clinical Medicine, College of Veterinary Medicine, University of Illinois Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Sept 2023 | Modified Apr 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Dogs with lymphoma (a cancer of malignant lymphocytes) most commonly develop nonpainful, generalized lymphadenopathy. Clinical signs such as lethargy, weight loss, and constitutional decline can occur with more advanced disease. Lymphoma can be diagnosed by means of either fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation or lymph node biopsy with histologic evaluation. Molecular diagnostic techniques, including flow cytometry and PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) assay, can also be helpful. Treatment is systemic with chemotherapy. Etiology | Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (2) Tables (1) Videos (0)  Lymphoma (malignant lymphoma or lymphosarcoma) in dogs arises from the uncontrolled and pathological clonal expansion of lymphoid cells of either B-cell or T-cell immunophenotype. Usually primary and secondary lymphoid tissues are involved, including the bone marrow, thymus, lymph nodes, and spleen.  In addition to these lymphoid-rich organs, extranodal sites that lymphoma affects include the skin, intestinal tract, liver, eye, CNS, and bone.  Etiology of Lymphoma in Dogs The underlying causes of malignant lymphoma in dogs remain incompletely characterized, and it is likely multifactorial. Potential contributing factors include infectious viruses or bacteria, environmental contamination with phenoxyacetic acid herbicides or other chemical exposures, strong magnetic fields, chromosomal abnormalities, and immune dysfunction.  Advanced genetic studies have revealed that lymphoma in dogs can be molecularly distinguished and categorized into discrete groups that correlate with biological aggressiveness.  Epidemiology of Lymphoma in Dogs Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic neoplasm in dogs, with a reported incidence approaching 0.1% of susceptible dogs.  Lymphoma in dogs usually occurs in middle-aged to older dogs. There is no significant association with sex. Some breeds may be at increased relative risk (eg, Boxer, Rottweiler, Golden Retriever); however, any breed can be affected.  Clinical Findings of Lymphoma in Dogs In dogs, lymphoma is a heterogeneous cancer, with variable clinical signs, responses to treatment, and survival times. The heterogeneity associated with canine lymphoma is influenced in part by several tumor and host factors, including anatomical involvement, extent of disease, morphological subtype, host constitution, and immunocompetence.  The most common clinical forms of canine lymphoma are high-grade T-cell or B-cell variants, which manifest as generalized, nonpainful, peripheral lymphadenopathy in 80%–85% of cases. Less commonly, lymphoma primarily affects other organ systems, including the alimentary tract, skin, mediastinum, and other extranodal sites.  In dogs with substantial tumor burden or paraneoplastic hypercalcemia, systemic constitutional signs, including profound lethargy, weakness, fever, anorexia, and dehydration, may become severe and life-limiting.  Alimentary lymphoma accounts for < 10% of all cases of canine lymphoma. Dogs with focal intestinal lesions may exhibit clinical signs consistent with partial or complete luminal obstruction (eg, vomiting, constipation, abdominal pain). With diffuse involvement of the intestinal tract, dogs with alimentary lymphoma may show marked and debilitating GI disturbances, including anorexia, vomiting, diarrhea, hypoproteinemia, and weight loss secondary to malabsorption and maldigestion.  Exclusive involvement of the cranial mediastinum characterizes only a small fraction of lymphoma cases. Typically, canine lymphoma is characterized by enlargement of the cranial mediastinal lymph nodes, thymus, or both. Mediastinal lymphoma arising from the thymus is predominantly high-grade malignant T-cell lymphoma. With advanced disease, clinical signs may include respiratory distress associated with pleural fluid accumulation, direct compression of adjacent lung lobes, or cranial vena cava syndrome.  In addition to respiratory signs, some dogs with mediastinal lymphoma may have primary polyuria with secondary polydipsia resulting from humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy, a paraneoplastic syndrome that occurs in 10%–40% of dogs with lymphoma. Humoral hypercalcemia of malignancy can be confirmed by measurement of the concentrations of ionized calcium, parathyroid hormone, and parathyroid hormone–related peptide (PTHrP) in circulating blood.  Cutaneous lymphoma, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Louis-Philippe de Lorimier.  The most common extranodal form of lymphoma involves the skin (ie, cutaneous lymphoma). Lesions associated with cutaneous lymphoma (epitheliotropic and nonepitheliotropic) may appear as solitary, raised, ulcerative nodules or generalized, diffuse, scaly lesions. The peripheral lymph nodes and mucocutaneous junctions are often involved.  Clinical signs associated with lymphoma that involve other extranodal sites may include respiratory distress (lungs), renal failure (kidneys), blindness (eyes), seizures (CNS), and skeletal pain or pathological fracture (bone).  Although the most commonly diagnosed type of lymphoma in dogs is high-grade lymphoma of either B-cell or T-cell origin, low-grade (indolent) lymphoma is a molecular variant. Indolent lymphoma consists of several histopathologic subtypes, including marginal-zone, follicular, mantle-cell, and T-zone lymphomas.  Indolent lymphomas most commonly involve the spleen or lymph nodes; generally, the clinical progression is slow. Dogs with indolent lymphomas often remain subclinically affected for a prolonged time, regardless of treatment.  Lesions Commonly, peripheral and various internal lymph nodes are 3–10 times normal size (multicentric form) in canine lymphoma, and nonpainful on digital palpation. Affected nodes are initially freely movable but firm. With disease progression, however, lymph nodes can become fixed and compress surrounding normal structures, leading to discomfort or functional compromise.  Histologically, effaced lymph nodes are gray to tan in coloration, and when transected, they bulge and lose cortical-medullary demarcation. Frequently, there is hepatosplenomegaly, with either diffuse enlargement or multiple, pale nodules of variable size disseminated in the parenchyma.  In the alimentary form of canine lymphoma, any part of the GI tract or mesenteric lymph nodes may be affected.  Involvement of the bone marrow, CNS, kidney, heart, tonsils, pancreas, and eyes is possible but less common.  Diagnosis of Lymphoma in Dogs Clinical evaluation  Fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation  Tissue biopsy with histologic evaluation  Molecular diagnostic techniques  On clinical examination, generalized, nonpainful lymphadenopathy should raise suspicion for multicentric lymphoma.  Fine-needle aspiration with cytologic evaluation is a highly effective and practical method for identifying pathological monomorphic populations of lymphoid cells. Cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma depends on the proportions of large (lymphoblastic), intermediate, and small (lymphocytic) lymphocytes assessed on multiple well-made, highly cellular fine-needle aspirate smears sampled from an entire lymph node or from multiple lymph nodes.  Fine-needle aspirate smear, Labrador Retriever   Image Image courtesy of Dr. Michael Rosser.  The key cytologic hallmark of most lymphomas in dogs is a cell population composed predominantly of a relatively homogeneous population of monomorphic, medium to large lymphocytes. Cytologic diagnosis of lymphoma involving small or intermediate lymphocytes can be more challenging, necessitating biopsy or molecular diagnostic testing.  Historically, histologic evaluation of tissue biopsy samples has been the gold-standard diagnostic test for morphological subtyping of canine lymphoma (diffuse versus follicular, cleaved versus noncleaved) and histologic grade (high versus low). Immunophenotyping enables further categorization of lymphomas by immunohistochemical staining into B-cell (CD79a) or T-cell (CD3) types.  Molecular diagnostic techniques may be helpful in the diagnosis of lymphoma in dogs.  Flow cytometry permits definitive diagnosis of lymphoma based on physical characteristics including size, complexity, and expression of surface markers such as CD markers (clusters of differentiation or classification determinants).  The PCR for antigen receptor rearrangement (PARR) assay enables the determination of clonality and is a sensitive method for confirming the neoplastic origin of lymphocytes and a diagnosis of lymphoma.  Staging Once a diagnosis of lymphoma has been established, clinical staging is performed to assess the extent of disease. Diagnostic imaging and assessment of bone marrow involvement may be necessary to ascertain the stage of disease. The WHO staging scheme is routinely used to stage lymphoma in dogs (see the table WHO Clinical Staging System for Lymphoma in Domestic Animals).  Table WHO Clinical Staging System for Lymphoma in Domestic Animals Treatment of Lymphoma in Dogs Systemic chemotherapy  Radiotherapy  Autologous bone marrow transplant  Given that only a small fraction of dogs achieve a cure with conventional treatment options, the primary goal for treatment is palliative.  Canine lymphoma is generally responsive to conventional systemic chemotherapy (initial response rate ≥ 90%); most dogs achieve improved quality of life and greater overall survival time. However (except in some forms of indolent lymphoma), eventual disease relapse is expected in most dogs, with disease that progressively becomes refractory to continued treatment.  In the treatment of high-grade lymphoma in dogs, the most common chemotherapeutic agents administered in combination protocols are cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunorubicin (doxorubicin), vincristine, and prednisone (ie, CHOP-based protocols; the \"O\" in \"CHOP\" comes from one trade name for vincristine). The addition of l-asparaginase is optional; often, this drug is reserved for clinically ill dogs or cases of relapse.  Other common chemotherapeutic agents with activity against naive and relapsing lymphoma include lomustine, mitoxantrone, and rabacfosadine.  With systemic multidrug chemotherapy protocols, median survival times in dogs are ~12 months for B-cell lymphoma and ~6–8 months for T-cell lymphoma.  Compared with combination protocols, single-agent chemotherapy, with the exception of doxorubicin treatment, does not typically achieve durable remission. Doxorubicin monotherapy can achieve complete remission, with a median survival time of 6–8 months, albeit with lower response rates than CHOP-based protocols achieve. Extravasation of doxorubicin can be catastrophic, and especially in dogs, cumulative cardiotoxicity results in a lifetime dose limit.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Extravasation of doxorubicin can be catastrophic, and especially in dogs, cumulative cardiotoxicity results in a lifetime dose limit.  Prednisone monotherapy can improve quality of life and can induce remission for a time (typically 1–2 months, but some dogs can have better outcomes). However, multidrug resistance can develop.  As of 2021, the FDA had conditionally approved verdinexor, a selective inhibitor of nuclear export (SINE) antineoplastic drug, for treatment of canine lymphoma. Response rates and durations appear to be lower than with available systemic multidrug chemotherapy protocols. Experience with this novel drug remains limited; however, it may provide an additional option for treatment in some dogs.  With no treatment, dogs die or are euthanized within 4–6 weeks.  Inclusion of half-body radiation therapy in conjunction with chemotherapy might improve the longterm control of canine lymphoma.  In autologous bone marrow transplants, malignant lymphoma cells are ablated with intensive chemoradiation strategies, and reinfusion of autologous bone marrow cells secondarily rescues the patient's hematopoietic system. This aggressive treatment is available at select institutions.  Despite the favorable outcomes expected in treating high-grade multicentric lymphoma, the successful management of other anatomical forms of lymphoma is often more difficult and less rewarding.  Alimentary lymphoma, if focal, can be treated effectively with surgical resection and combination chemotherapy. However, diffuse involvement of the intestinal tract, low constitutional reserve, severe malabsorption of nutrients, and loss of proteins often result in poor clinical responses and short survival times (< 3 months).  For mediastinal lymphoma, chemotherapy alone or combined with focal ionizing radiotherapy (in patients that might have appreciable pleural effusion or space-occupying complications—ie, those with associated dyspnea) can achieve favorable survival times and good quality of life.  Cutaneous lymphoma can be controlled for limited amounts of time, often < 3–6 months, by treatment with lomustine, doxorubicin, or rabacfosadine, or a combination protocol.  For indolent lymphoma, low-intensity oral chemotherapy protocols (chlorambucil and prednisone) often provide prolonged survival times (> 2 years).  In some dogs with localized and low-grade disease (eg, splenic involvement), splenectomy can be an effective treatment option without requiring adjuvant chemotherapy. (Also see Targeted Antineoplastic Agents.)  Key Points Lymphoma is the most common hematopoietic tumor affecting dogs.  Lymphoma in dogs is often diagnosed through a combination of findings on physical examination and cytologic evaluation of fine-needle aspirates of enlarged lymph nodes.  Most dogs with lymphoma respond positively to systemic chemotherapy, with improved quality of life and overall survival time.  Although most lymphomas in dogs are multicentric, large B-cell tumors, lymphoma is a heterogeneous disease, and thorough diagnostic testing and categorization can influence treatment recommendations and prognosis. Overview of Hemostatic Disorders in Animals ByErin McQuinn, DVM, DACVIM (SAIM), Iowa State University College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed ByJoyce Carnevale, DVM, DABVP, College of Veterinary Medicine, Iowa State University Reviewed/Revised Feb 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Physiological Understanding of Hemostasis | Clinical Approach to Assessing Hemostasis | Key Points | For More Information | References Effective hemostasis depends on an adequate number of functional platelets, an adequate concentration and activity of plasma coagulation and fibrinolytic proteins, and a normally responsive blood vasculature. The diagnosis, treatment, and monitoring of hypo- and hypercoagulable animals is difficult with regard to both the progression of disease and the monitoring of blood component and/or anticoagulant therapy.  Citrated plasma samples are often used in veterinary medicine to determine fibrinogen concentration, activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and D-dimer or fibrinogen degradation product (FDP) concentration.  The introduction of the cell-based tissue factor (TF)/factor VII–dependent model of hemostasis has enhanced understanding of the complex biochemistry of physiological hemostasis, leading to reevaluation of the traditional cascade model of physiological hemostasis, which divides coagulation into intrinsic and extrinsic pathways.  Although citrated plasma contains many of the factors involved in coagulation, whole blood contains not only these soluble factors but also the cellular components (eg, TF and phospholipid) that participate in normal and pathological hemostasis.  Physiological Understanding of Hemostasis in Animals The traditional model of hemostasis, known as the cascade or waterfall model, divides coagulation proteins into an extrinsic and an intrinsic arm or pathway, both of which lead to a final, common pathway ending in formation of fibrin. This model offers a simplified understanding of how factors activate one another; however, it might not accurately reflect complex and overlapping interactions of procoagulant elements, especially the importance of cell surfaces.  Pearls & Pitfalls  The cascade model of hemostasis simplifies the complex and overlapping interactions of procoagulant elements but may not be as biologically accurate as the cell-based model.  The cell-based model of hemostasis has been introduced to explain hemostasis through the interaction of vascular tone, blood flow, endothelial cells, platelets, and leukocytes, as well as coagulation and fibrinolytic factors, cofactors, and inhibitors (1). These interactions, under normal circumstances, result in balanced hemostasis, ensuring that there is formation of a clot at an injured site, inhibition of clotting when not needed, and fibrinolysis of clots when appropriate.  This dynamic model involves cellular regulation of coagulation in three phases: initiation, amplification, and propagation.  Initiation: TF-bearing cells initiate hemostasis. TF (factor III) is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor found in extravascular tissues, including organ capsules and the adventitia of blood vessel walls. It is constitutively expressed on fibroblasts, and upon cellular activation it is also expressed on vascular smooth muscle cells, monocytes, and neutrophils. The TF-bearing cells and platelet surfaces act as the main surfaces for assembly of procoagulant complexes.  Any vessel injury leads to TF exposure. Factor VII binds to TF, resulting in activation to factor VIIa. Factor VIIa that is bound to TF on the cell surface, the \"extrinsic tenase complex,\" activates factor IX to factor IXa and factor X to factor Xa. Initially, the formed factor Xa is limited to the TF-bearing cell because factor Xa that diffuses away from the cell is rapidly inhibited by TF pathway inhibitor (TFPI) or antithrombin.  Amplification: Factors Va and Xa assemble into the \"prothrombinase complex\" on the surface of the TF-bearing cell. A small, priming amount of factor IIa (thrombin) is initially generated close to the cell. This small amount of thrombin is not enough to lead to clot formation; however, it amplifies clot-forming elements by activating platelets to release factor V, causing von Willebrand factor to release factor VIII, and activating factors V, VIII, and XI.  Platelets are also activated by other mechanisms, including exposure of vessel wall collagen and von Willebrand factor, leading to platelet adhesion and aggregation at the injured site. Activated platelets aggregate to form the initial platelet plug that precedes the fibrin clot.  Propagation: As an essential part of platelet activation, the procoagulant phospholipid phosphatidylserine becomes available on the exterior surface of platelets. In the propagation phase of the cell-based model, the binding of factor IXa to activated platelets promotes formation of the \"intrinsic tenase complex\" of factor IXa, factor VIIIa, phosphatidylserine, and calcium.  Factor IXa activated during the initiation phase by the interaction of factor VIIa and TF-bearing cells is able to diffuse to the surface of activated platelets because it is not inhibited by TFPI and is only slowly inhibited by antithrombin.  Factor IX can also be activated on the surface of platelets by factor XIa. Formation of the intrinsic tenase complex on the surface of activated platelets results in abundant factor Xa formation. As in the amplification phase, factor Xa complexes with factor Va, forming the \"prothrombinase complex\" on the surface of activated platelets and leading to the cleavage of factor II (prothrombin) and a major subsequent burst of factor IIa (thrombin). Thrombin cleaves factor I (fibrinogen) to factor Ia (fibrin), forming a fibrin clot.  The thrombin burst in the propagation phase activates plasmin, thereby initiating fibrinolysis, which keeps the clot controlled at the site of injury. To control fibrinolysis, the antifibrinolytic pathway is activated by thrombin activation of thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). TAFI slows the fibrinolytic process by inhibiting plasmin activity, thereby preventing premature clot lysis and enabling clot propagation.  The balance of fibrin formation and fibrinolysis regulates the size and quality of the fibrin clot and localizes it to the injury site. The quality of the clot has a marked impact on how effectively it provides hemostasis.  Clinical Approach to Assessing Hemostasis in Animals Although the traditional division between primary, secondary, and tertiary (fibrinolysis) hemostasis is not biologically accurate, it is still a useful approach to assessing hemostasis in animals with acquired or hereditary hemostatic disorders.  Primary hemostasis is accomplished by interaction of platelets with exposed subendothelial surfaces and results in a platelet plug. Simultaneously, plasma coagulation proteins are activated in a sequential cascade that depends on the phospholipid provided by the activated platelets and on calcium ions from plasma to form a stable fibrin clot (secondary hemostasis). Circumstances that activate platelets and the coagulation proteins also activate plasma fibrinolytic proteins, which ensure localization of the clot and its timely dissolution (tertiary hemostasis).  Tests of Primary Hemostasis Tests of primary hemostasis include in-clinic tests such as platelet count and buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT), as well as tests offered by reference laboratories, such as platelet closure time and von Willebrand factor (vWF) measurement.  Platelet counts can be estimated from peripheral blood smears. Platelets can be activated upon blood collection, leading to clumping and underestimated machine platelet counts, which emphasizes the importance of manual blood smear analysis. Apparent thrombocytopenia caused by in vitro platelet agglutination should not cause spontaneous bleeding.  Platelet counts can be lower than the reference range in clinically normal Greyhounds and other sight hound breeds. EDTA-induced platelet clumping occurs occasionally in dogs and horses (pseudothrombocytopenia), and cat platelets activate and clump readily during blood collection.  Buccal mucosal bleeding time is a point-of-care screening test commonly used to assess primary hemostasis in dogs. The lip is inverted, and a spring-loaded, automated lancet device produces a standardized incision on the mucosal side. Blood adjacent to the wound is gently blotted with absorbing paper every 5 seconds until bleeding stops. Canine BMBT is reported as normal (< 4 minutes) or abnormal. BMBT can also be measured in cats; however, the test is uncommonly used clinically, it usually requires sedation, and the technique and interpretation are not well standardized or documented (2).  Platelet closure time, measured by a platelet function analyzer, provides a quantitative, simple, and rapid in vitro assessment of primary platelet-related hemostasis at high shear stress. The test requires a small volume of citrated whole blood, which is drawn under vacuum through a 200-mcm-diameter stainless steel capillary and a 150-mcm-diameter aperture in a nitrocellulose membrane coated with collagen and epinephrine (CEPI) or collagen and ADP (CADP). A platelet aggregate forms that blocks blood flow through the aperture; the time taken to occlude the aperture is reported as the closure time.  Prolonged platelet closure times occur with inherited and acquired platelet function disorders, including von Willebrand disease. Platelet function analyzers also can be used to monitor response to treatment with both desmopressin acetate and glycoprotein IIb/IIIa antagonists.  Assays of canine vWF are typically required for diagnosis of von Willebrand disease and include measurement of vWF antigen concentration and collagen-binding assays for measurement of vWF activity.   Tests of Secondary Hemostasis Tests of secondary hemostasis include plasma-based assays measuring activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and prothrombin time (PT).  aPTT assesses factors of the intrinsic (XII, XI, IX, VIII) and common (X, V, II, I) pathways.  PT assesses factors of the extrinsic (VII) and common pathways.  Measurement of the activity of individual coagulation factors can identify additional specific factor deficits, helping to localize and define the problem in animals suspected of having hemostatic disease.  Tests of Tertiary Hemostasis The fibrinolytic system (tertiary hemostasis) is traditionally evaluated with measurements of clot breakdown products, such as FDPs and D dimers.  Endogenous anticoagulant ability has been evaluated via the measurement of antithrombin, protein C, and protein S activity.  Viscoelastic Testing Plasma-based coagulation screening tests can help identify defective or deficient coagulation proteins. Although this traditional approach makes it possible to effectively and systematically localize causes of bleeding, it can be difficult from a clinical perspective to globally evaluate clotting disturbances that affect multiple stages of hemostasis, identify hypercoagulable states, and monitor the effect of anticoagulant or procoagulant treatment.  One reason for this difficulty might be that plasma-based tests of the secondary and tertiary systems target specific elements of the hemostatic system, thus potentially ignoring other factors that could substantially contribute to overall hemostatic capability in acquired disorders. Another plausible reason is the low sensitivity of aPTT and PT; usually, activity of a coagulation protein must be < 30% and sometimes < 10% of normal before an abnormality is detected.  Viscoelastic testing, such as thromboelastography or thromboelastometry, enables rapid assessment of hemostatic function in whole blood. Because whole blood contains the soluble factors and cellular components involved in hemostasis, whole blood assays can provide a more accurate reflection of in vivo hemostasis than can traditional plasma-based hemostasis assays. These modalities evaluate all the steps of hemostasis, including initiation, amplification, and propagation, as well as fibrinolysis, which includes the interaction of platelets and leukocytes with the proteins of the coagulation cascade.  Viscoelastic testing modalities evaluate both the traditional plasma components of coagulation and the cellular components. Viscoelastic testing is performed on unstabilized fresh whole blood within minutes of taking a blood sample, and coagulation pathways are assessed after chemical activators have been added to the sample. Viscoelastic testing modalities analyze the dynamics of clot formation time, clot strength, and clot breakdown.  Viscoelastic testing is the first modality available to clinicians that can evaluate hypercoagulability. It is a valuable aid in the diagnostic evaluation of animals with abnormal hemostasis and a supplement to traditional coagulation tests such as PT, aPTT, D-dimer, and fibrinogen assays.  Point-of-care viscoelastic testing machines are becoming more widely available, and abundant emerging research seeks to translate observations from various viscoelastic testing modalities into clinically meaningful information for a variety of hyper- and hypocoagulable disorders in a variety of species.  Key Points The primary stage of hemostasis requires normal number and function of platelets and von Willebrand factor to form a plug.  In secondary hemostasis, a fibrin clot forms via TF-bearing cells, activated platelet surfaces, and clotting factors. The extent of the clot is controlled by fibrinolysis (tertiary hemostasis).  Traditional evaluation of coagulation could involve a combination of tests of primary, secondary, and tertiary stages. Viscoelastic testing enables a more global assessment of interacting hemostatic pathways.

Congenital or acquired defects or deficiencies of platelets usually manifest as superficial petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages (especially of mucous membranes), epistaxis, melena, or prolonged bleeding at injection and incision sites.  Congenital or acquired deficiencies of coagulation proteins usually manifest clinically as delayed or recurring deep tissue hemorrhage, hematoma formation, and bleeding into joints and body cavities. Petechiae generally do not occur in conditions caused by abnormalities in coagulation proteins.  Pathological thrombosis can result from primary or inherited disorders of anticoagulant protein factors or, more commonly, from acquired disorders. Collectively, these conditions are called hypercoagulable states.  Syndromes, such as DIC, that enhance platelet responsiveness to agonists and alter the balance between anticoagulant and procoagulant protein factors or that increase the reactivity of endothelium are always secondary to another disease or injury that must be recognized and treated for a successful outcome.

Acquired thrombocytopenia is the most common.  Congenital Thrombocytopenia in Animals Hereditary Macrothrombocytopenia Hereditary macrothrombocytopenia is a benign, inherited giant platelet disorder that affects approximately 30–50% of Cavalier King Charles Spaniels. It has been identified in numerous other dog breeds as well, including Norfolk and Cairn terriers. It is characterized by thrombocytopenia with macrothrombocytes resulting from mutations in the beta-1-tubulin gene, which encodes a protein necessary for megakaryocyte division into platelets of normal size.  The disorder is suspected in dogs with persistently low platelet counts on routine CBCs, in the absence of bleeding, and it does not require intervention. Affected dogs commonly have platelet counts in the range of 50,000–100,000/mcL, or lower, depending on the accuracy of the analyzer and the condition of the sample. Hereditary macrothrombocytopenia must be differentiated from thrombocytopenia that is due to pathological causes.  Genetic testing is available and can be valuable to avoid unnecessary and potentially harmful treatment (and associated costs and worry) that may be given for pathological causes of thrombocytopenia.  Cyclic Hematopoiesis (Gray Collie Syndrome) Cyclic hematopoiesis is an autosomal recessive disorder that was originally identified in Collies and has rarely been reported in dogs of other breeds. It is also known as \"gray Collie syndrome\" because affected Collies have abnormal, dark pewter-gray to silver coat pigmentation (1, 2, 3).  Cyclic hematopoiesis is characterized by a mutation in the canine AP3B1 gene that results in 12-day cycles of cytopenia.  All marrow stem cells are affected; however, neutrophils are the most affected because of their short half-life (usually < 24 hours). Mild to severe thrombocytopenia can occur, and excessive bleeding is a potential complication.  Cyclic hematopoiesis is fatal; affected dogs usually die from fulminating infections before they are 6 months old. Even dogs that receive intensive antimicrobial treatment usually die by the age of 3 years, with amyloidosis secondary to chronic antigenic stimulation from recurrent infections.  Treatment with recombinant granulocyte colony-stimulating factor has been found to be successful in temporarily alleviating the neutropenic cycles until antibodies are produced against the noncanine proteins (4).  Collie breeders have successfully minimized the occurrence of cyclic hematopoiesis, and it exists now mostly in laboratory animals used for the study of hematopoiesis.  Genetic testing is available to enable early detection and subsequent monitoring in an individual animal; it could also help breeders identify carriers.  Fetal and Neonatal Alloimmune Thrombocytopenia Fetal and neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia is a rare disorder that occurs when maternal antibodies are produced against a paternal antigen on fetal platelets.  Neonatal alloimmune thrombocytopenia has been reported in a 1-day-old Quarter Horse foal. In the reported case, indirect assays identified immunoglobulins bound to the foal’s platelets in the mare’s plasma, serum, and milk. The immunoglobulins were further shown to recognize platelets from the foal’s full brother, born 1 year earlier (5). This diagnosis should be considered for foals with severe thrombocytopenia when other causes can be excluded.  A group of lambs artificially reared and fed bovine colostrum developed subcutaneous bruising, weakness, pale mucous membranes, and severe thrombocytopenia with prolonged bleeding from puncture wounds due to ear tag placement. All affected lambs died within 48 hours of birth. The presence of antibodies directed against platelets was suspected because the cows from which colostrum was obtained had been used in a previous experiment in which they had been immunized against sheep blood (6).  Acquired Thrombocytopenia in Animals Acquired thrombocytopenia is reported frequently in dogs and cats, less often in horses, and rarely in other species. Frequently, thrombocytopenia is secondary to a broader systemic process in clinically ill animals, and artifactually low machine platelet counts are common in animals.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Spontaneous bleeding due to thrombocytopenia does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 30,000/mcL.  Spontaneous bleeding due to thrombocytopenia does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 30,000/mcL. Hemorrhage from trauma (eg, venipuncture, organ aspirates, surgery) does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 50,000/mcL.  If spontaneous bleeding or surgical bleeding complications occur in the face of a platelet count above the minimum platelet count threshold, multifactorial coagulation abnormalities should be considered.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Hemorrhage from trauma does not typically occur until platelet counts are lower than approximately 50,000/mcL.  Causes of acquired thrombocytopenia can broadly result from increased platelet consumption (to stop hemorrhage or in pathological thrombosis), accelerated destruction, lack of production, or sequestration in the spleen.  Immune-Mediated Thrombocytopenia Immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP) is characterized by immune-mediated destruction of either circulating platelets or, less commonly, marrow megakaryocytes. It has been reported in dogs, horses, and, rarely, cats. Middle-aged female dogs, especially Cocker Spaniels, are overrepresented.  Clinical signs of ITP include petechiae of the gingivae or skin, as well as ecchymosis, melena, hematuria, ocular bleeding, and/or epistaxis. Some dogs with extremely low platelet counts remain clinically unaffected. Platelet counts are usually < 30,000/mcL and often < 10,000/mcL at the time of diagnosis.  ITP can be classified as either primary (with no identifiable trigger) or secondary to a wide variety of infections (particularly vector-borne infections), drugs, and neoplastic or inflammatory diseases. There is little evidence to support vaccination as a cause of ITP in dogs; however, it might be in rare instances.  A variety of tests have been developed to prove the presence of antiplatelet antibodies; however, none have shown dependable sensitivity and specificity.  ITP diagnosis is usually based on the exclusion of other causes of thrombocytopenia in a patient with verifiable and severe thrombocytopenia. A bone marrow aspirate can help determine whether megakaryocytes have been targeted; it is rarely needed, though, because marrow megakaryocytes are less commonly the target, and treatment and prognosis are similar whether or not megakaryocytes are decreased.  Patients with ITP should be kept at rest to avoid exacerbating bleeding tendencies.  Treatment involves immunosuppression, often initially by corticosteroid administration, starting at a high dose and then tapering (as in the treatment of hemolytic anemia). A single injection of vincristine (0.01–0.02 mg/kg, IV) at the start of treatment has been shown to shorten the time to recovery of the platelet count (7). Dogs that received prednisone and vincristine had a significantly faster increase in platelet count to > 40,000 platelets/mcL than dogs that received prednisone alone (mean +/- SD, 4.9 +/- 1.1 vs 6.8 +/- 4.5 days, respectively).  Alternative immunosuppressive drugs (eg, modified cyclosporine, mycophenolate mofetil) are sometimes used (in addition to corticosteroids) to minimize longterm reliance on corticosteroids and/or for refractory or relapsing cases.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Whole blood and platelet transfusions will not normalize platelet numbers, but they might slow ongoing platelet consumption in patients with severe, life-threatening bleeding.  Transfusion with fresh whole blood or packed RBCs should be performed in animals with clinical signs related to anemia. Whole blood and platelet transfusions will not normalize platelet numbers; however, they might help to slow the ongoing, consumptive siphon for platelets in patients with severe and life-threatening bleeding.  Therapeutic plasma exchange has been described for the treatment of ITP in dogs (8) and could be an option at referral centers offering this form of therapy. Splenectomy should be reserved as a treatment for animals that have recurrent episodes of thrombocytopenia.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Splenectomy should be considered only in animals that have recurrent or refractory thrombocytopenia.  The platelet count should be monitored while immunosuppressive medications are slowly tapered (over a period of 4–6 months or longer) because relapses can occur. Drugs that interfere with coagulation should be avoided.  Rickettsial Diseases Infections caused by Rickettsia rickettsii (the causative agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever), Anaplasma platys, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia ewingii, or Ehrlichia canis, which are transmitted by ticks, cause mild to severe thrombocytopenia in dogs.  A platys infection usually is characterized by mild, often cyclic thrombocytopenia in the acute stages of disease. Chronic infections often involve constant mild to moderate thrombocytopenia. Morulas (single to multiple, round to oval basophilic inclusions) can sometimes be identified in platelets of infected dogs. Thrombocytopenia due to A platys is seldom severe enough to result in clinical bleeding tendencies.  E canis infections are characterized by variable alterations in total WBC, RBC, and platelet counts. Acute infections usually involve thrombocytopenia, and possibly anemia or leukopenia. Chronic infections sometimes involve thrombocytopenia or anemia; also there is often leukopenia and sometimes hyperglobulinemia (monoclonal or polyclonal).  A phagocytophilum infection has been documented in a wide variety of domestic and wild animals. It is characterized by bleeding, fever, lethargy, and a reluctance to move. Changes in blood parameters include thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia. Morulas can occur in granulocytes.  Treatment for these rickettsial infections is doxycycline. Chronic E canis infections might not respond well; however, some dogs can survive without clinical signs despite subnormal RBC, WBC, and platelet counts, especially in endemic areas.  Neoplasia In addition to other mechanisms for causing thrombocytopenia, hemangiosarcoma, lymphoma, and carcinoma can be associated with consumptive thrombocytopenia due to DIC. Immunological and inflammatory mechanisms cause increased platelet consumption and decreased platelet survival time. However, bleeding tendencies without thrombocytopenia occasionally occur. Altered platelet function due to an acquired membrane defect has been associated with hyperglobulinemia. Vasculitis also can contribute to the hemostatic disorder.  Drug-Induced Thrombocytopenia Thrombocytopenia associated with the administration of certain drugs has been reported in dogs, cats, and horses. One mechanism is marrow suppression of megakaryocytes or generalized marrow stem cell suppression (after administration of estrogen, chloramphenicol, phenylbutazone, diphenylhydantoin, phenobarbital, or sulfonamides). Another mechanism is increased platelet destruction and consumption (after administration of sulfisoxazole, aspirin, diphenylhydantoin, ristocetin, levamisole, methicillin, or penicillin).  Drug reactions are idiosyncratic and therefore unpredictable. Platelets usually return to normal shortly after the drug is discontinued. Drug-induced bone marrow suppression can be prolonged. The chemotherapy drug lomustine has sometimes caused prolonged thrombocytopenia that persists after the drug is stopped.  Other Causes of Thrombocytopenia Many infectious and inflammatory diseases can lead to vasculitis, platelet activation, and thrombocytopenia. Platelet count can be low if platelets are consumed during appropriate clotting to try to stop a hemorrhage, as in trauma or disorders of secondary hemostasis. They can also be consumed during pathological thrombosis (such as hypercoagulable states or DIC). Platelet count can be low with a variety of bone marrow disorders, including toxicoses, infections, myelofibrosis, or myelophthisis, with or without other cytopenias.  Quantitative platelet disorders have been reported in liver disease with or without coagulation protein deficiencies.  In two studies of cats with thrombocytopenia, 29–50% had infectious diseases, including feline leukemia, feline infectious peritonitis, panleukopenia, or toxoplasmosis (9, 10).  Feline leukemia virus replicates and accumulates in megakaryocytes and platelets. Aplasia or hypoplasia of marrow stem cells, immune destruction of infected platelets, or extravascular sequestration of platelets within lymphoid tissues can contribute to thrombocytopenia in cases of feline leukemia virus infection.  Intravascular parasites can also cause platelet activation and removal.  Bovine viral diarrhea virus can cause thrombocytopenia in cattle.  Platelets can be sequestered in the spleen when the spleen is congested, such as during sedation or anesthesia.  The mechanism of thrombocytopenia is not identified in many cases.  Congenital Platelet Function Disorders in Animals Congenital disorders of platelet function affect platelet adhesion, aggregation, or secretion. They can be either intrinsic or extrinsic to platelets.  Testing of intrinsic platelet function requires careful handling of samples and specialized equipment that is not routinely available in diagnostic laboratories; therefore, the incidence of intrinsic functional defects in platelets is not accurately known. However, if a coagulopathy exists (especially with petechiae or mucosal bleeding) but results of coagulation screening, platelet count, and von Willebrand factor assessment are normal, then a platelet function disorder should be suspected.  There is no specific treatment for any intrinsic platelet function disorder. In instances of severe hemorrhaging, platelet transfusion products can be administered to aid hemostasis. Whole blood or packed RBCs can be administered to patients with clinical signs of anemia.  Von Willebrand Disease Von Willebrand disease, caused by defective or deficient von Willebrand factor (vWF, formerly called factor VIII–related antigen), is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs (reported in nearly all breeds and in mixed breeds). The disease has been reported also in cats, rabbits, cattle, horses, and pigs.  The disease is relatively common (10–70% prevalence) in several breeds of dogs: Doberman Pinscher, German Shepherd Dog, Golden Retriever, Miniature Schnauzer, Pembroke Welsh Corgi, Shetland Sheepdog, Basset Hound, Scottish Terrier, Standard Poodle, and Standard Manchester Terrier. Many dogs with von Willebrand disease are subclinically affected.  Canine von Willebrand disease is classified into three subtypes based on clinical severity, plasma vWF concentration, and vWF multimer composition:  Type 1, the most common form, is characterized by mild to moderate clinical signs, low vWF concentration, and a normal multimer distribution.  Type 2 is characterized by moderate to severe clinical signs, low vWF concentration, and a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers.  Type 3, which occurs most commonly in Shetland Sheepdogs and Scottish Terriers, is a severe disorder characterized by total absence of vWF.  Two modes of inheritance for von Willebrand disease are known. In the less common autosomal recessive pattern of inheritance, homozygosity is usually fatal, and heterozygosity results in subclinically affected carriers. In the more common inheritance pattern of autosomal dominance with incomplete penetrance, homozygotes and heterozygotes can have variable bleeding tendencies.  Affected animals can have gingival bleeding, epistaxis, and hematuria. Some puppies bleed excessively only after injection, venipuncture, or surgery, such as tail docking, ear cropping, or dewclaw removal.  vWF circulates as a complex with coagulation factor VIII and mediates platelet adhesion to subendothelial surfaces—the first step in clot formation. The most common clinical sign of von Willebrand disease is mucosal bleeding, usually without evidence of petechiae or bruising, which occurs postoperatively in some affected animals.  Von Willebrand disease should be suspected in animals with clinical signs of a platelet disorder, normal coagulation screening tests (activated partial thromboplastin time [aPTT] and prothrombin time [PT]), adequate platelet counts, and long buccal mucosal bleeding time (BMBT). BMBT is a good screening test in dogs with signs of a platelet disorder and a normal platelet count.  Diagnosis is confirmed by identification of low vWF concentration in plasma or via DNA screening.  Occasionally, affected animals can have decreased factor VIII coagulant and therefore have prolonged aPTT and activated clotting time (ACT).  Drugs known to interfere with normal platelet function should be avoided in animals with suspected von Willebrand disease. Transfusion of cryoprecipitate, fresh frozen plasma, or fresh whole blood effectively alleviates a bleeding episode.  Type 1 von Willebrand disease could respond to treatment with desmopressin acetate, which causes release of high-molecular-weight multimers from the endothelium. Desmopressin (1 mcg/kg, SC, 30 minutes before surgery, using a sterile solution) can be administered to these dogs before surgery to minimize bleeding complications.  Concomitant hemostatic abnormalities can exacerbate von Willebrand disease. Hypothyroidism was once thought to be associated with von Willebrand disease; both conditions are prevalent in many of the same dog breeds (eg, Doberman Pinschers and Golden Retrievers). Thyroid hormone supplementation in hypothyroid dogs without deficiency of vWF has been found not to increase vWF activity; in fact, in most of the tested dogs, vWF activity decreased (11). Therefore, levothyroxine cannot be recommended as a treatment for von Willebrand disease, and it might even exacerbate the disease.  Chédiak-Higashi Syndrome Chédiak-Higashi syndrome is an autosomal recessive disorder characterized by abnormal granule formation in leukocytes, melanocytes, and platelets (see Morphologic Leukogram Abnormalities). The defect appears to be in microtubule formation; therefore, a decreased number of granules that are abnormally large are evident in numerous types of cells. Diluted coat color results from the defect in the melanocytes.  Leukocytes can have decreased functional ability to phagocytose and kill organisms (an inconsistent finding in animals), and platelets have decreased aggregation and release reactions. Platelets are almost devoid of dense granules and have markedly decreased storage quantities of adenosine diphosphate and serotonin.  Prolonged bleeding in blue smoke Persian cats with Chédiak-Higashi syndrome occurs after venipuncture or surgery. The syndrome also has been diagnosed in mink, cattle, and beige mice with similar bleeding tendencies.  Canine Thrombopathia Canine thrombopathia has been described in Basset Hounds and Landseers as well as some spitz-type dogs. Inheritance is autosomal with variable penetrance.  Platelets have abnormal fibrinogen receptor exposure and impaired dense granule release. Dogs with mucosal bleeding and petechiation that have normal platelet counts and vWF should be suspected of having thrombopathia.  Specific diagnosis of canine thrombopathia requires specialized platelet function testing.  Genetic tests are available for affected breeds to identify carriers and inform breeding.  Bovine Thrombopathia Bovine thrombopathia is an autosomally inherited platelet function defect of Simmental cattle. Bleeding can be mild to severe in affected cattle and is exacerbated by trauma or surgery. Platelets have impaired aggregation responses.  Glanzmann Thrombasthenia Glanzmann thrombasthenia (formerly called thrombasthenic thrombopathia) is an autosomally transmitted disorder that has been diagnosed in Otterhound and Great Pyrenees dogs and in Thoroughbred, Quarter Horse cross, Peruvian Paso, and Oldenburg horses.  Affected animals have prolonged BMBTs and form hematomas at sites of venipuncture or injury. Blood smears show numerous bizarre, giant platelets (30–80% of all platelets).  Because of decreased synthesis of either glycoprotein IIb or IIIa, the membrane receptor glycoprotein IIb/IIIa is decreased or lacking on the surface of platelets. To date, all known affected animals have had a defect in IIb synthesis.  Blood from animals with Glanzmann thrombasthenia does not have normal clot retraction, and platelets do not aggregate normally after stimulation with adenosine diphosphate, collagen, or thrombin.  Canine Platelet Procoagulant Deficiency (Scott Syndrome) Canine platelet procoagulant deficiency (Scott syndrome) is an inherited bleeding disorder in which platelets are unable to exteriorize phosphatidylserine needed as a site of interaction for key clotting factors. This condition has been described rarely in German Shepherd Dogs and is characterized by postoperative hemorrhage and bruising.  Acquired Platelet Function Disorders in Animals Several diseases have been associated with acquired platelet function disorders. Hyperglobulinemia associated with multiple myeloma induces a platelet membrane defect that results in impaired hemostatic function. In uremia associated with any form of renal disease, platelet adhesion and aggregation are decreased.  Liver disease can affect not only platelet number but also platelet function. Because the effects on procoagulant and anticoagulant clotting factors vary, bleeding tendencies are challenging to predict in patients with liver disease.  In addition to affecting platelet number, DIC impairs platelet aggregation.  Numerous drugs also can impair platelet function:  Drugs reported to block platelet receptor binding or to change platelet membrane charge or permeability include furosemide, penicillin, carbenicillin, lidocaine, phentolamine, and chlorpromazine.  Drugs that inhibit the transduction of messages received at the platelet surface include caffeine, theophylline, dipyridamole, and papaverine.  Drugs that inhibit the execution of platelet responses (aggregation, secretion, or thromboxane production) include aspirin, indomethacin, phenylbutazone, other NSAIDs, ticlopidine, pentobarbital, and sulfinpyrazone.  Clopidogrel and related drugs decrease ADP-induced platelet aggregation.  Key Points Clinical signs of platelet disorders include petechiae, ecchymoses, mucosal bleeding, and persistent oozing of blood after injury or surgery.  Thrombocytopenia is much more common than thrombopathia, with immune-mediated thrombocytopenia the most common cause of severe thrombocytopenia in dogs.  Von Willebrand disease is the most common cause of abnormal buccal mucosal bleeding time despite normal platelet count.  For More Information Lattimer KS (ed). Hemostasis.

Marked decreases in activity of coagulation proteins essential to hemostasis are usually fatal. With < 1% of normal activity, animals can be stillborn or die shortly after birth as a result of massive hemorrhage.  Insufficient production of coagulation proteins or limited access to vitamin K by the immature neonatal liver can exacerbate a coagulation defect.  If activity of any particular coagulation protein is 5–10% of normal, the neonate could survive; however, signs of a congenital coagulation disorder usually appear before the age of 6 months. It is during this time—when teething and routine procedures (eg, vaccination, castration, ovariohysterectomy) are usually performed—that a bleeding tendency can become apparent.  Most of the congenital coagulation protein disorders reported in domestic animals are deficiencies or abnormalities of a single factor.  Factor I (Fibrinogen) Deficiency Primary fibrinogen deficiency can be divided into afibrinogenemia, hypofibrinogenemia, and dysfibrinogenemia.  Congenital afibrinogenemia has been reported in a family of Saanen dairy goats. It has rarely been described in dogs and cats.  Hypofibrinogenemia, accompanied by severe bleeding, has been reported in Saint Bernards and Vizslas and in one mixed-breed dog; the activated clotting time (ACT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and thrombin time (TT) were prolonged.  Dysfibrinogenemia has been reported in an inbred family of Borzois. The ACT, aPTT, PT, and TT were prolonged; however, the presence of fibrinogen was revealed by quantitative testing. Affected dogs had mild bleeding episodes with epistaxis and lameness, but trauma or surgery resulted in life-threatening bleeding. To stop the bleeding, IV administration of fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate is the best treatment.  Factor II (Prothrombin) Disorders Factor II (prothrombin) disorders are rare.  Boxers have been reported to have normal concentrations of abnormally functioning prothrombin. The defect is inherited as an autosomal recessive trait.  A disorder of factor II has been reported in English Cocker Spaniels.  Clinical signs in affected puppies (epistaxis and gingival bleeding) decrease with age, and adults bruise easily or have dermatitis. In affected puppies, TT is normal, but ACT, aPTT, and PT are prolonged.  The treatment is transfusion of fresh frozen plasma or fresh whole blood, if RBCs are needed.  Factor VII Deficiency Factor VII deficiency has been reported in Beagles, English Bulldogs, Alaskan Malamutes, Alaskan Klee Kais, Miniature Schnauzers, Boxers, and mixed-breed dogs.  Factor VII deficiency is inherited in an autosomal pattern with incomplete dominance.  Usually, factor VII deficiency is not associated with spontaneous bleeding; however, affected dogs can have bruising or prolonged bleeding after surgery. Prolonged postpartum hemorrhaging has been reported.  Factor VII deficiency is usually diagnosed coincidentally when coagulation screening tests are performed. The PT is prolonged, whereas aPTT and other test results are normal.  Factor VIII Deficiency (Hemophilia A) Factor VIII deficiency (hemophilia A) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder in dogs and cats. It has also been reported in several breeds of horses, including Arabians, Standardbreds, Quarter Horses, and Thoroughbreds.  There is an X-linked pattern of inheritance, so usually females are subclinically affected carriers and males are affected. Rarely, in highly inbred families, breeding of a carrier female with an affected male can produce affected female offspring.  In puppies with factor VIII deficiency, prolonged bleeding occurs from the umbilical vessels after birth; from the gingiva during tooth eruption; and after surgery such as tail docking, dewclaw removal, or ear cropping.  Hemarthrosis accompanied by intermittent lameness, spontaneous hematoma formation, and hemorrhagic body cavity effusions also are common clinical findings in dogs with < 5% of normal factor VIII activity. Animals with 5–10% of normal activity often do not bleed spontaneously but exhibit prolonged bleeding after trauma or surgery. Affected cats and sometimes small dogs can show prolonged bleeding after surgery or trauma; however, rarely do they bleed spontaneously, probably because of their agility and light weight.  Affected animals usually have very low concentrations of factor VIII (< 10%) and prolonged ACT and aPTT. Von Willebrand factor (vWF) concentrations are greater than or equal to normal. Carrier animals have intermediate concentrations of factor VIII (40–60%), and results of coagulation screening tests are usually normal. Care should be taken in diagnosis if animals are < 6 months old, because of possible low production of coagulation factors by an immature liver. Usually, results of coagulation screening tests are normal in carrier animals.  Treatment of bleeding diatheses requires repeated transfusions of cryoprecipitate or fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, every 8–12 hours) until bleeding has been controlled. Unless the patient has clinical signs of anemia, fresh frozen plasma or cryoprecipitate is preferable to whole blood because of possible sensitization to RBC antigens with repeated transfusions.  Factor IX Deficiency (Hemophilia B) Factor IX deficiency (hemophilia B) is diagnosed less often than factor VIII deficiency. It has been reported in several breeds of purebred dogs, a mixed-breed dog, a family of Siamese-cross cats, and a family of British Shorthair cats. The defect is X-linked with carrier females and affected males; however, affected females can occur in closely inbred families.  Clinical signs of factor IX deficiency are similar to those of factor VIII deficiency. Some animals show no signs until trauma or surgery. The ACT and aPTT are prolonged. Carrier animals with 40–60% of normal factor IX activity are usually subclinically affected, and results of coagulation screening tests are normal.  Treatment of factor IX deficiency requires transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, every 12 hours) until bleeding resolves. Often, hemorrhage into the abdomen, thorax, or CNS, or between muscle fascial planes, occurs and can be undetected until a crisis.  Factor X Deficiency Factor X deficiency has been reported in a single family of American Cocker Spaniels; the inheritance pattern is autosomal dominant with variable penetrance (1).Factor X deficiency has also been reported in a Chihuahua and a Jack Russell Terrier (2, 3).  Homozygotes usually die early in life or are stillborn because of massive internal hemorrhage. Heterozygotes have mild to severe bleeding problems.  ACT, aPTT, and PT are usually prolonged when animals have < 30% normal factor X activity.  Transfusions with fresh or fresh frozen plasma are required to control hemorrhage.  Factor XI Deficiency Factor XI deficiency has been recognized in Kerry Blue Terriers, a female English Springer Spaniel, a Great Pyrenees dog, Weimaraners, and Holstein cattle.  Inheritance is autosomal; however, whether the gene is dominant or recessive is not known. A single case involving an adult cat that had epistaxis and systemic lupus erythematosus was attributed to a circulating inhibitor of factor XI.  Mild deficiencies usually go undetected. In severe deficiencies with factor XI at 30–40% or less of normal activity, mild prolonged bleeding can occur after trauma or surgery.  Bleeding tendencies in patients with factor XI deficiency usually are not immediate, but delayed 3–4 days. ACT and aPTT are usually prolonged.  Transfusion with fresh frozen plasma (10 mL/kg, IV, once) is sufficient to stop bleeding for up to 3 days.  Factor XII (Hageman Factor) Deficiency In dogs, factor XII (Hageman factor) deficiency has been reported in German Shorthaired Pointers, Standard Poodles, and a family of Miniature Poodles; in cats it is also commonly reported. Affected animals do not have clinical bleeding problems. This deficiency is usually diagnosed coincidentally when coagulation screening tests show prolonged aPTT.  Humans with factor XII deficiency do not have bleeding problems; however, they do show a predisposition to thrombosis or infections, which is attributed to the normal role of factor XII in fibrinolysis and complement activation. Tendencies for thrombosis or infection have not been reported in animals.  Factor XII deficiency has been found to coexist with von Willebrand disease in dogs and with factor IX deficiency in cats. In affected animals, bleeding tendencies are not exacerbated (4, 5).  Factor XII is not present in the plasma of birds, marine mammals, and reptiles, without untoward effects.  Deficiency of Factors II, VII, IX, and X Deficiency of factors II, VII, IX, and X has been described in Devon Rex cats that experienced bleeding, most commonly after surgery. Bleeding can be controlled by vitamin K administration, and some of these cats appear to overcome this bleeding tendency as adults.  Prekallikrein Deficiency Prekallikrein deficiency has been reported in Poodles, a family of miniature horses, and a family of Belgian horses. Clinical bleeding problems are not usually apparent; however, excessive bleeding after castration was reported in one horse (6). The diagnosis is usually made coincidentally when coagulation screening tests are performed. ACT and aPTT are usually prolonged.  Poor Clot Strength Poor clot strength in Greyhounds has been found to cause delayed postoperative bleeding.Viscoelastic testing studies comparing Greyhound and non-Greyhound dogs have shown that Greyhounds have longer times to initial and maximal clot formation, lower maximal amplitude (7, 8), and faster clot breakdown (8). Epsilon-aminocaproic acid is effective at preventing or stopping bleeding in affected dogs (9).  Acquired Coagulation Protein Disorders in Animals Liver Disease Most coagulation proteins are produced primarily in the liver. Therefore, liver disease characterized by necrosis, inflammation, neoplasia, or cirrhosis often is associated with decreased production of coagulation proteins, anticoagulants, and fibrinolytic proteins. Because the various coagulation proteins have a relatively short half-life (4 hours–2 days), mild to marked deficiencies secondary to severe hepatopathies can result.  aPTT and/or PT is prolonged in 50–75% of dogs with severe liver disease (10), meaning that the factor activity is < 30% of normal. Because of the wide-reaching impact of liver disease on many aspects of hemostasis, it is difficult to predict bleeding tendencies in affected dogs. Coagulation tests are often performed before liver biopsy.  Severe hepatic diseases can also lead to DIC. Activities of fibrinogen (an acute phase reactant) and vWF (which is produced extrahepatically) may be increased in some individuals with liver disease.  Vitamin K Deficiency Vitamin K is solubilized in mixed micelles before its passive diffusion across the brush border of the intestines. Fat malabsorption associated with inadequate amounts of bile salts (as with biliary obstruction), lymphangiectasia, or severe villous atrophy can result in vitamin deficiency and coagulopathy because the functional vitamin K−dependent factors II, VII, IX, and X cannot undergo carboxylation necessary for their activation.  Ingestion of Anticoagulant Rodenticides Ingestion of anticoagulant rodenticides causes a coagulopathy because functional vitamin K−dependent factors cannot undergo carboxylation necessary for their activation. Inactive precursor coagulation factors II, VII, IX, and X are still produced by the liver; however, gamma-carboxylation of the inactive precursors does not occur, because the rodenticide inhibits the epoxide reductase enzyme required for recycling active vitamin K.  Anticoagulant rodenticide ingredients are classified by generation, with first-generation and intermediate-generation poisons necessitating multiple feedings to kill the target species. Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides are more potent and kill in a single feeding.  First-generation anticoagulant rodenticides include the coumarin class (containing ingredients like warfarin, pindone, coumafuryl, and coumachlor) and the indanedione class (containing ingredients like chlorophacinone and diphacinone). These two classes are derived from different chemical structures.  Second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides include brodifacoum, bromadiolone, difenacoum, and difethialone.  The half-lives of second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides are much longer; they depress clotting factors for 2–4 weeks, compared to the 7–10 days of depression produced by first- and intermediate-generation anticoagulant rodenticides.  Animals that ingest anticoagulant rodenticides can develop bruising or hematomas over pressure points or in the nasopharynx after minor trauma from ingested hard or sharp particles. Bleeding into body cavities can occur, resulting in acute collapse. Often, affected animals do not bleed within the first 24 hours after ingesting the toxin. aPTT, PT, and ACT are usually prolonged.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Factor VII has the shortest half-life of the vitamin K−dependent coagulation proteins; therefore, prothrombin time is often abnormal before other tests and can be used to monitor response to treatment.  Factor VII has the shortest half-life of the vitamin K−dependent coagulation proteins; therefore, PT is often abnormal before other tests and can be used to monitor response to treatment.  In cases of acute ingestion, emetics, absorbents, and cathartics are administered to minimize absorption. Vitamin K therapy is often initiated in animals exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides even if they do not show clinical signs.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Vitamin K therapy is often initiated in animals exposed to anticoagulant rodenticides even if they do not show clinical signs of poisoning.  The recommended treatment for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning is to administer phytonadione (vitamin K1) at an initial dosage of 2.5–3 mg/kg, SC, once, followed by 1.25–2.5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours for 14–28 days. PT should be measured 48 hours after completion of the initial course, and if it has not yet normalized, treatment should be continued for another week (followed by measurement of PT again 48 hours later).  Intoxication with long-acting, second-generation anticoagulant rodenticides is more common, so shorter treatment durations should be considered only if the animal is known to have ingested a short-acting, first-generation anticoagulant rodenticide. IV administration of vitamin K1 is not recommended, because anaphylactic reactions can result. Administration of vitamin K3 is not useful. Treatment protocols are similar for most domestic species.  In addition to instituting vitamin K therapy, clinically affected (eg, bleeding) animals could require treatment with blood products. The vitamin K–dependent clotting factors can be transfused via frozen, fresh frozen, or fresh plasma. RBCs can be delivered to clinically anemic patients as packed RBCs. Finally, clotting factors combined with RBCs can be delivered in fresh or stored whole blood.  Ingestion of Moldy Sweet Clover Dicumarol formation in moldy sweet clover antagonizes vitamin K as described above for anticoagulant rodenticides. Ingestion can cause hemorrhage. Cattle are most commonly affected; horses, sheep, pigs, and other species can also be affected (see Sweet Clover Poisoning). Treatment is similar to that for anticoagulant rodenticide poisoning, but the duration is short: phytonadione (vitamin K1) administered at 1–1.5 mg/kg, SC, every 24 hours for 2–3 days.  Disseminated Intravascular Coagulation DIC is not a primary disease; rather it is a syndrome that occurs secondary to numerous underlying diseases, such as bacterial, viral, rickettsial, protozoal, or parasitic diseases; heat stroke; burns; neoplasia; or severe trauma. Commonly, the underlying disease causes sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS), an uncontrolled mixed pro- and anti-inflammatory state characterized by massive activation and consumption of coagulation proteins, endogenous inhibitors, fibrinolytic proteins, and platelets.  In the initial stage of DIC, the animal is hypercoagulable because of circulating inflammatory mediators that activate hemostasis via increased exposure of TF and inhibitor consumption. With time, consumption of coagulation factors can lead to a hypocoagulable state with overt bleeding.  Because of the progressive nature of DIC, clinical findings vary considerably and range from no overt signs of disease, accompanied by subtle, if any, changes in routine hemostasis parameters (aPTT, PT, D-dimer, fibrinogen, and platelet count), to clinical signs of organ failure associated with microvascular thrombosis in vital organs, finally culminating in overt bleeding. The latter has historically been considered the typical DIC case, in which there are also pronounced alterations in hemostasis parameters and a drop in platelet count.  Viscoelastic testing can differentiate the DIC stage in dogs. Dogs in the hypercoagulable stage have a much better chance of survival than do dogs in the hypocoagulable stage. This higher chance of survival is likely because of early and aggressive intervention through supportive and/or antithrombotic therapy while the underlying disease is treated. Aggressive treatment likely minimizes thromboembolic complications and delays or even prevents progression to overt signs.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Viscoelastic testing can differentiate the DIC stage in dogs. Dogs in the hypercoagulable stage have a much better chance of survival than do dogs in the hypocoagulable stage.  In veterinary medicine, laboratory diagnosis of DIC is not standardized, and hemostatic function test results are not consistent; however, diagnosis of DIC is often based on the presence of three or more abnormal hemostatic parameters, such as aPTT, PT, fibrinogen concentration, D-dimer concentration, platelet count, and RBC morphology, along with a predisposing underlying disease. The increasing availability of viscoelastic testing has made definitive diagnosis of DIC possible. Postmortem fibrinolysis makes necropsy an insensitive diagnostic criterion.  Treatment of DIC must be directed first at diagnosing and treating the underlying disease. In addition, if the patient is hypercoagulable, heparin is indicated. If hypocoagulability and bleeding are present, heparin is no longer indicated; instead, fresh frozen plasma should be administered. Supportive care with fluids and possibly plasma expanders helps to maintain effective circulating volume.  Key Points Animals with clotting factor abnormalities are likely to develop hematomas or bleed into body cavities or joints.  Important inherited factor abnormalities often become evident at teething or after surgery.  Treatment of anticoagulant rodenticide toxicosis can require 4–6 weeks of treatment with vitamin K1.  DIC is always secondary to another condition, and treatment must address the underlying disorder as well as the coagulopathy.

Abnormal clot formation can lead to thrombosis, clot extension, and thromboembolism.  Clinically, abnormal clot formation can go unnoticed; however, thromboembolic disease of substantial size or major sites (eg, brain, lungs, aorta) can cause profound clinical signs, organ damage, and death. Thromboembolic disease complicates many common diseases in veterinary medicine.  Congenital Anticoagulant Disorders in Animals Congenital deficiency of any anticoagulant protein has not been recognized in domestic animals. If such a condition exists in animals, it is probably incompatible with life.  Acquired Procoagulant Disorders in Animals The presence of hypercoagulability is difficult to assess clinically in dogs and cats.  The importance of hypercoagulability and thromboembolic disease was not well defined in veterinary medicine until the advent of viscoelastic testing, which enables global assessment of hemostatic function in whole blood. Advantages of viscoelastic testing include evaluation of the viscoelastic properties of developing blood clots (including clot formation, kinetics, strength, stability, and resolution) and immediate detection of hyper- and hypocoagulable states.  Certain diseases in animals have been associated with increased risk of thrombosis. Cats with cardiomyopathy, especially those with an enlarged left atrium, can develop large thromboemboli in the aorta or brachial artery. Heartworm disease can also be associated with thrombosis in cats. Thrombosis has been reported in dogs with protein-losing nephropathies, hyperadrenocorticism, protein-losing enteropathy, neoplasia, heat stroke, sepsis, heartworm disease, and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia. Dogs with pancreatitis have been found to have evidence of hypercoagulability, and in some dogs the presence of multiple comorbid processes listed here increases the risk of thrombosis. Thrombi and thromboemboli have been reported in horses with systemic inflammatory diseases (eg, colic, laminitis, or equine ehrlichial colitis) and in instances of prolonged jugular catheter placement and infusion of drugs that irritate the vasculature.  Neoplasia is also a risk factor for hypercoagulability and likely associated complications, such as thromboembolic disease. Many cells and proteins involved in maintaining hemostasis are also involved in cancer growth, invasion, metastasis, and angiogenesis. Deep vein thrombosis is an important clinical complication in human cancer patients; however, whether the same is true in dogs with cancer is unknown.  In protein-losing nephropathies (eg, glomerulopathies, nephrotic syndrome, renal amyloidosis), a deficiency of antithrombin has been well documented. With a molecular weight of 57,000 kilodaltons (kD), antithrombin is similar in size to albumin (60,000 kD); therefore, glomerular lesions sufficient to result in albumin loss also result in antithrombin loss. Other abnormalities identified in renal disease include increased responsiveness of platelets to agonists, increased procoagulant activities, and decreased antiplasmin activity.  Hypercholesterolemia has been associated with increased risk of thromboembolism. It is hypothesized that endothelial and platelet membrane phospholipid concentrations are altered, leading to damaged vasculature and increased platelet responsiveness to agonists, respectively. Increased production of thromboxane via the cyclooxygenase pathway in platelets has been observed. Diseases characterized by hypercholesterolemia include hyperadrenocorticism, diabetes mellitus, nephrotic syndrome, hypothyroidism, and pancreatitis. All have been associated with increased risk of thrombus formation, often pulmonary thrombosis.  In cats with cardiomyopathy, endomyocardial lesions and turbulent blood flow through the heart chambers and valves secondary to altered myocardial functioning are thought to initiate thrombus formation. Specific deficiencies of anticoagulant or fibrinolytic proteins have not been reported. Although antithrombin is markedly increased in these cats, it does not provide protective benefits. Cats with cardiac disease secondary to hyperthyroidism are often treated not only with drugs to alter thyroid function, but also with drugs (eg, propranolol, atenolol, or diltiazem) that abate clinical signs of cardiac dysfunction.  Horses that have colic associated with endotoxemia have decreased plasminogen activity and protein C antigen concentration. Their mortality rate and risk of thrombus formation are increased. Laminitis is thought to be the end result of several diverse systemic disorders. Microthrombi in the vasculature of the hoof lamina have been identified in the early stages of laminitis. One theory is that endotoxin has direct effects on the vasculature and activates contact factors in the coagulation cascade. Ischemia of the lamina secondary to edema, vascular compression, and possible blood shunting at the level of the coronet also damage endothelium. When circulation is reestablished, reperfusion injury results, and the exposed subendothelial collagen promotes thrombosis.  Thromboprophylaxis (clot prevention) is standard treatment in some diseases of small animals, including protein-losing nephropathy and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (1). In addition, clot prevention may be considered in small animals with multiple hypercoagulable diseases.  In an animal with thrombi or thromboemboli, it is imperative to diagnose and manage any underlying disease processes, and to provide good supportive care, including pain management.Maintenance of adequate tissue perfusion is critical.  Pearls & Pitfalls  Diagnosis and management of underlying diseases and provision of supportive care, including pain management, is imperative in animals with thrombi or thromboemboli.  Dissolution of clots and prevention of clot extension by administration of anticoagulants (eg, heparin, direct factor Xa inhibitors) and antiplatelet drugs (eg, aspirin, clopidogrel) has had mixed success, in part because of a lack of evidence regarding effective dosing of these drugs for clot prevention.  Unfractionated heparin is most commonly used as initial treatment. Low-molecular-weight heparins have been evaluated in cats with aortic thromboembolism; however, the cost is appreciably higher, and no clear benefit has been shown when compared with unfractionated heparin.  Heparin facilitates the action of antithrombin, but to be effective, adequate antithrombin must be present. In dogs with protein-losing nephropathies or in horses with endotoxemia, plasma transfusion could be necessary before heparin therapy is effective. For clot prevention in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia, individually adjusting heparin doses according to anti-Xa activity has been found to improve outcomes, compared with nonindividualized (standardized) dosing (2).  Drugs that inhibit factor Xa (eg, rivaroxaban and apixaban) can be administered orally and do not require frequent monitoring. Their use is being studied in dogs and cats; however, expense is an issue. Currently, the only treatment shown to increase survival time after the initial thrombotic event in cats is clopidogrel (18.75 mg/cat, PO, every 24 hours longterm), which inhibits platelet function.  Use of fibrinolytic compounds to enhance dissolution of clots has shown promise in animals.  Tissue plasminogen activator (TPA), also known as alteplase, has more fibrin specificity than does streptokinase or urokinase and, therefore, provides more localized fibrinolytic effects. The main deterrent to the use of TPA is its high cost. A study of cats with aortic thrombosis that were treated with TPA found a risk for reperfusion injury and hyperkalemia after the clot dissolved (3).  Streptokinase is more available and less expensive; however, the therapeutic dose is difficult to determine. In addition, many animals have naturally occurring antibodies to streptokinase as a result of previous streptococcal infections.  Key Points Many of the underlying diseases that cause DIC can also cause localized thromboembolism.  Aortic thromboembolism in cats with cardiomyopathy has a guarded prognosis, as well as risk of recurrence.  Thromboprophylaxis (clot prevention) is recommended for a number of diseases in small animals including protein-losing nephropathy and immune-mediated hemolytic anemia.\n","Successfully saved 'circulatory_system.txt' to Google Drive\n","add another file?

Creevy, DVM, MS, DACVIM-SAIM, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A & M University; Jeremy B. Evans, DVM, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2022 | Modified Jun 2025 Canine distemper is a highly infectious, systemic, viral disease of dogs that occurs worldwide. Dogs commonly exhibit systemic clinical signs (fever, lethargy, loss of appetite), respiratory signs (nasal discharge, pneumonia), and GI signs (diarrhea), variably followed by neurologic signs (muscle twitching, focal or generalized seizures), which may be delayed. Vaccination is available and is generally effective. Diagnosis is made by recognition of the clinical signs, along with confirmation through antibody assays or reverse transcriptase PCR. Treatment is generally supportive, and the prognosis varies with the severity of the neurologic signs. Etiology and Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Prevention | Key Points | For More Information  Clinically, canine distemper is characterized by:  a diphasic fever  respiratory discharge and pneumonia  diarrhea and inappetence  frequently, neurologic complications  The epidemiology of canine distemper is complicated by the large number of species susceptible to infection. The disease occurs in Canidae (dogs, foxes, wolves, raccoon dogs), Mustelidae (ferrets, mink, skunks, wolverines, martens, badgers, otters), most Procyonidae (raccoons, coatimundis), some Viveridae (binturongs, palm civets), Ailuridae (red pandas), Ursidae (bears), Elephantidae (Asian elephants), primates (Japanese monkeys), and large Felidae (cats). Domestic dogs (including feral populations) are considered to be the reservoir species in most, if not all, locations. Antigenic drift and strain diversity is increasingly documented in association with outbreaks in wild species, domestic dogs, and exotic animals held in zoos and parks.  Etiology and Pathogenesis of Canine Distemper Canine distemper virus is a paramyxovirus closely related to the viruses of measles and rinderpest. The fragile, enveloped, single-stranded RNA virus is relatively unstable outside the host. Infection is transmitted mainly via aerosol droplet secretions from infected animals. Some infected dogs may shed virus particles for several months.  The virus initially replicates in the lymphatic tissue of the respiratory tract. A cell-associated viremia results in infection of all lymphatic tissues, which is followed by infection of respiratory, GI, and urogenital epithelium, as well as the CNS and optic nerves. Disease follows virus replication in these tissues. The extent of viremia and of virus transmission to various tissues is moderated by the extent of specific humoral immunity in the host during the viremic period.  Clinical Findings of Canine Distemper A transient fever usually occurs 3–6 days after infection with canine distemper virus, and there may be leukopenia (characterized by lymphopenia) at this time; these clinical signs may go unnoticed or may be accompanied by anorexia. The fever subsides for several days before a second fever occurs, which may be accompanied by serous nasal discharge, mucopurulent ocular discharge, lethargy, and anorexia. GI and respiratory signs, typically complicated by secondary bacterial infections, may follow; rarely, pustular dermatitis may be observed. Encephalomyelitis may occur in association with these signs, follow the systemic disease, or occur in the absence of systemic signs. Dogs surviving the acute phase may have hyperkeratosis of the footpads and epithelium of the nasal planum, as well as enamel hypoplasia in incompletely erupted teeth.  Overall, a longer course of illness is associated with the presence of neurologic signs; however, there is no way to anticipate whether an infected dog will develop neurologic manifestations.  Typical neurologic signs include:  localized involuntary muscle twitching (myoclonus, chorea, flexor spasm, hyperkinesia)  seizures, including salivation and chewing movements of the jaw (chewing-gum fits)  Other neurologic signs include:  circling  head tilt  nystagmus  paresis to paralysis  seizures ranging in type from focal to generalized  Emerging viral strains may be associated with greater neurotropism. Increased morbidity and mortality from neurologic complications has been observed.1  A dog may exhibit any or all of these multisystemic clinical signs during the course of the disease. Infection may be mild and inapparent or lead to severe disease with most of the described clinical signs. The course of the systemic disease may be as short as 10 days; however, the onset of neurologic signs may be delayed several weeks or months as a result of chronic progressive demyelination within the CNS.  Clinicopathologic findings are nonspecific and include lymphopenia, with the possible finding of viral inclusion bodies in circulating leukocytes very early in the course of the disease. Thoracic radiographs may reveal an interstitial pattern typical of viral pneumonia.  Chronic distemper encephalitis (old dog encephalitis, or ODE), a condition often marked by ataxia, compulsive movements such as head pressing or continual pacing, and incoordinated hypermetria, may be observed in fully vaccinated adult dogs without a history suggestive of systemic canine distemper infection. Although canine distemper antigen has been detected in the brains of some dogs with ODE by fluorescent antibody staining or genetic methods, dogs with ODE are not infectious, and replication-competent virus has not been isolated. The disease is due to an inflammatory reaction associated with persistent canine distemper virus infection in the CNS; however, the mechanisms that trigger this syndrome are unknown.  Lesions Thymic atrophy is a consistent postmortem finding in young puppies infected with canine distemper virus. Hyperkeratosis of the nose and footpads is often found in dogs with neurologic signs. Depending on the extent of secondary bacterial infection, bronchopneumonia, enteritis, and skin pustules also may be present. In cases of acute to peracute death, exclusively respiratory abnormalities may be found. Histologically, canine distemper virus produces necrosis of lymphatic tissues, interstitial pneumonia, and cytoplasmic and intranuclear inclusion bodies in respiratory, urinary, and GI epithelium.  Lesions found in the brains of dogs with neurologic complications include:  neuronal degeneration  gliosis  noninflammatory demyelination  perivascular cuffing  nonsuppurative leptomeningitis  intranuclear inclusion bodies, predominantly within glial cells  References Origgi FC, Plattet P, Sattler U, et al. Emergence of canine distemper virus strains with modified molecular signature and enhanced neuronal tropism leading to high mortality in wild carnivores. Vet Pathol. 2012;49(6):913–929.  Diagnosis of Canine Distemper Preliminary diagnosis: clinical evaluation  Confirmation: reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) and antibody detection tests  Canine distemper should be considered in the diagnosis of any febrile condition in dogs with multisystemic clinical signs involving the respiratory, GI, and/or neurologic systems. Unvaccinated dogs, or dogs of unknown vaccination status, should be particularly suspected. An appropriate index of suspicion based on clinical signs is a necessary first step. Widely available RT-PCR and antibody detection tests (ELISA, immunofluorescence assay [IFA]) are used to confirm the presence of virus or an immune response against it in appropriately selected clinical cases.  Clinical signs in the respiratory and GI systems may be modified by, or confused with, concurrent parasitism and numerous viral or bacterial infections. Characteristic neurologic signs sometimes do not appear until late in the disease.  Distemper in dogs can be confused with other systemic infections, such as:  parvovirus infection  infectious canine tracheobronchitis  infectious canine hepatitis  Intoxicants such as lead or organophosphates can cause simultaneous GI and neurologic signs.  In dogs with multisystemic clinical signs, IFA or RT-PCR can be used to examine:  smears of conjunctival, tracheal, nasal, vaginal, or other epithelium  the buffy coat of the blood  transtracheal wash fluid  urine  bone marrow aspirates  Commercially available RT-PCR may not distinguish natural infection from vaccine-derived virus; however, quantitative RT-PCR may overcome this limitation. Antibody titers or ELISA can be performed on CSF and compared with peripheral blood; a relatively higher number of antibodies in the CSF is typical of natural infection versus vaccination. Viral antigen IFA or fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) for viral DNA can be performed on biopsies from the footpads or from the haired skin of the dorsal neck.  At necropsy, diagnosis is usually confirmed by histologic evaluation of lesions, IFA, FISH, or a combination of these. Tissue IFA often is negative when the dog is showing only neurologic signs or when circulating antibody is present (or both), requiring that the diagnosis be made by CSF evaluation or RT-PCR analysis.  Treatment of Canine Distemper Supportive care  As with most diseases due to viruses, supportive care is the mainstay of treatment for canine distemper. Patients require nutrition and hydration support, defense against secondary bacterial infections, protection against the consequences of seizures, and excellent nursing care to optimize the chances of a successful immune response to the virus.  Treatment includes:  administration of prophylactic broad-spectrum antimicrobials  provision of balanced electrolyte solutions  provision of parenteral nutrition  administration of antipyretics, analgesics, and anticonvulsants  excellent nursing care  No single treatment of canine distemper is specific or uniformly successful. Experimental in vitro work with antiviral agents shows promise; however, these agents have not yet been widely used. The use of porcine-derived anti-canine-distemper-virus antibodies has shown promise: naturally infected puppies that were administered xenogeneic antibodies as an adjunct to standard supportive care had an increased rate of survival compared to puppies that received only supportive care.1 In addition, for further supportive care, one case report described the use of intramuscular injections of botulinum toxin in one dog to alleviate severe and debilitating myoclonus associated with infection.2  Unfortunately, treatment for acute neurologic manifestations of distemper is frequently unsuccessful. If the neurologic signs are progressive or severe, the owner should be appropriately advised. With prompt, aggressive care, dogs may recover completely from multisystemic clinical signs; in other cases, however, neurologic signs may persist after GI and respiratory signs have resolved. Some dogs with chronic progressive forms of neurologic disease may respond to glucocorticoid therapy.  References Liu PC, Chen CA, Chen CM, et al.

Prevention of Canine Distemper With the potential increasing virulence of emerging strains and the wide host range of canine distemper virus, widespread vaccination of domestic dogs is essential. Successful immunization of pups with canine distemper modified live virus (MLV) vaccines depends on the lack of interference by maternal antibodies. To overcome this barrier, pups are vaccinated with MLV vaccine when 6 weeks old and at 3- to 4-week intervals until 16 weeks old. Alternatively, measles virus vaccine induces immunity to canine distemper virus in the presence of relatively greater amounts of maternal distemper antibodies. MLV measles vaccine is administered intramuscularly to pups 6–7 weeks old and is followed with at least two more doses of MLV distemper vaccine at 12–16 weeks old.  Many varieties of attenuated distemper vaccine, as well as recombinant vaccine, are available and should be administered according to manufacturers’ directions. MLV vaccines should not be administered in late-pregnancy or early-lactation bitches. MLV vaccines can produce postvaccinal illness in some immunosuppressed dogs. A recombinant canarypox vector vaccine expressing distemper virus proteins is licensed for use in ferrets; the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians recommends extra-label use of this vaccine in many at-risk species held in zoos and parks.  Historically, annual revaccination has been standard because of the breaks in protection that can occur in stressed, diseased, or immunosuppressed dogs, and because vaccines have been labeled for annual administration. Substantial evidence supports the finding that immunity induced by MLV distemper vaccines lasts ≥ 3 years. In many cases, however, a vaccination frequency of less than annual remains an extra-label administration of the vaccine; thus, decisions to revaccinate less often than annually should be considered in light of local prevalence of the disease and other potential risk factors, as well as industry and professional-organization recommendations.  Canine distemper virus is sensitive to lipid solvents such as ether, as well as most disinfectants, including phenols and quaternary ammonium compounds; these substances should be part of the cleaning and disinfection protocols at kennels and veterinary premises.  Key Points Canine distemper is a highly infectious, multisystemic viral infection of dogs, with variable neurologic outcomes.  Diagnosis depends on recognition of the characteristic clinical signs in an at-risk dog, followed by specific detection of the virus itself, or an immune response against it.  Treatment is primarily supportive. The patient's own immune response is necessary to resolve the infection. Among survivors, full recovery from respiratory and GI signs is expected; however, the neurologic prognosis is unpredictable. Leptospirosis in Dogs ByKatharine F.

Diagnosis includes serologic testing and identification of leptospires in tissues, blood, or urine. Doxycycline is the primary drug used for treatment in dogs, along with appropriate supportive care. Polyvalent vaccines are available for prevention. Specific serovars in a geographic area vary, so vaccines with the appropriate types should be used. Because it is a zoonotic disease, clinicians must remain vigilant for leptospirosis and should be aware of its different clinical presentations.

Dogs are the maintenance host for Leptospira interrogans serovar Canicola, and before widespread vaccination programs, serovars Canicola and Icterohaemorrhagiae were the most common serovars in dogs in the US. The prevalence of canine serovars has shifted significantly in the past few decades, and the serovars that cause disease in dogs are likely to vary with geographic region and the presence of reservoir hosts. Unfortunately, current understanding of the serovars that cause natural disease in dogs is limited by the fact that isolation of leptospires is rarely performed; thus, studies to date have relied on serologic data.  Unfortunately, the results of serologic testing (with the microscopic agglutination test [MAT]) do not reliably predict the infecting serovar in dogs (or humans) with leptospirosis; thus, the true infecting serovar is unknown in most cases. However, it is likely that the serovars that cause disease in dogs are those circulating in local wildlife.  Knowledge of the infecting serovar in dogs is essential for epidemiological studies and vaccine development; it is less important for clinicians managing individual cases.  It is currently not known whether specific serovars are associated with specific clinical signs of leptospirosis in dogs, and there is no published evidence to guide therapy based on serovar identification. It is, however, extremely important for veterinarians to maintain a high index of suspicion for leptospirosis, because this is a zoonotic disease and has a wide range of clinical presentations in dogs. Any age, breed, or sex of dog is susceptible to leptospirosis, and the diagnosis should not be excluded on the basis of signalment or lifestyle. Canine leptospirosis is not restricted to large-breed dogs, male dogs, or dogs with a predominantly outdoor lifestyle.  Clinical Signs and Test Results of Leptospirosis in Dogs Acute kidney injury has been the most common presentation for canine leptospirosis in recent years. Dogs affected by leptospirosis might show clinical signs that include lethargy, anorexia, vomiting, abdominal pain, and polyuria, oliguria, or anuria.  Serum biochemistry or serum blood gas analysis might show abnormalities such as azotemia, hyperphosphatemia, metabolic acidosis, hyponatremia, and hypo- or hyperkalemia.  Urinalysis might show abnormalities such as hyposthenuria, isosthenuria, or minimal concentration; proteinuria; glucosuria (with normal blood glucose); cylindruria; hematuria; or pyuria.  Dogs that survive acute kidney injury may return to baseline or progress to chronic kidney disease. Leptospirosis should also be considered in any dog with previously diagnosed chronic kidney disease that develops acute-on-chronic kidney injury.  Polyuria and polydipsia in the absence of azotemia is also observed in some dogs with leptospirosis, possibly as a result of nephrogenic diabetes insipidus. Leptospirosis could also potentially be associated with renal tubular acidosis.  Acute liver disease can accompany acute kidney injury in dogs with leptospirosis, or it can occur alone. Clinical signs might include icterus, vomiting, anorexia, and lethargy.  Icterus, dog with leptospirosis   Image Courtesy of Dr. Katharine F. Lunn.  Serum biochemical analysis might show the following abnormalities:  Increased alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity  Increased ALT activity (usually less increased than ALP activity)  Increased bilirubin concentration  Muscle pain, stiffness, weakness, trembling, or reluctance to move can occur in dogs with leptospirosis. These signs can be the result of vasculitis, myositis, or nephritis. Myalgia is commonly reported in human leptospirosis and is associated with the septicemic phase of the disease.  Less common manifestations of canine leptospirosis include bleeding disorders, suspected to be caused by vasculitis. Clinical signs may include petechial hemorrhages, epistaxis, melena, and hematemesis. A CBC might show mild to moderate thrombocytopenia (not severe enough to cause spontaneous bleeding). Coagulation testing might show increased fibrin degradation products, prolonged prothrombin time (PT) or prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT).  Pulmonary hemorrhage is now one of the most common clinical signs in outbreaks of human leptospirosis. This is a less common finding in canine leptospirosis; however, cough or dyspnea, or radiographic abnormalities have been noted in a number of affected dogs.  Uveitis is an uncommon manifestation of leptospirosis in dogs. It appears to be infrequently associated with experimental canine leptospirosis; however, rare case reports exist.  Additional clinical signs reported in dogs with leptospirosis include vomiting, diarrhea, weight loss, fever, hypothermia, oculonasal discharge, lymphadenopathy, effusions, and edema.  Other nonspecific CBC changes might include neutrophilia, lymphopenia, monocytosis, or mild anemia.  Thoracic radiographs might show diffuse or caudodorsal reticulonodular pulmonary opacities, likely because of pulmonary hemorrhage. Abdominal radiographs might be normal or might show renomegaly or hepatomegaly.  Thoracic radiograph, dog with leptospirosis, ventrodorsal view   Image Courtesy of Dr. Katharine F. Lunn.  Thoracic radiograph, dog with leptospirosis, left lateral view   Image Courtesy of Dr. Katharine F. Lunn.  Thoracic radiograph, dog with leptospirosis, right lateral view   Image Courtesy of Dr. Katharine F. Lunn.  Changes noted on abdominal ultrasound examination might include renomegaly, pyelectasia, increased cortical or medullary echogenicity, perinephric effusion, hyperechoic renal medullary band, hepatomegaly, hypoechoic liver, gallbladder abnormalities, or abdominal effusion or edema. These changes are not specific for leptospirosis, and absence of these findings does not exclude the diagnosis.  Gross necropsy findings can include jaundice, effusions, and petechial or ecchymotic hemorrhages on any organ, pleural, or peritoneal surface. The kidneys and liver might be enlarged, and lungs can be wet, heavy, and discolored. The liver is often friable with an accentuated lobular pattern and might have a yellowish-brown discoloration. The kidneys might have white foci on the subcapsular surface. Microscopic findings in the liver could include mild random hepatocytic necrosis, nonsuppurative hepatitis, and intrahepatic bile stasis, while swollen tubular epithelial cells, tubular necrosis, and a mixed inflammatory reaction can occur in the kidneys.  Diagnosis of Leptospirosis in Dogs Combination of the following findings: acute azotemia, cholestatic liver disease, mild to moderate thrombocytopenia, and glucosuria with normal blood glucose  Serologic testing to detect antibodies, combined with PCR assay to detect organisms  The results of all diagnostic tests should be interpreted in light of the animal's vaccination history, clinical signs, and clinicopathologic findings. The table Comparison of Tests Used to Diagnose Leptospirosis in Dogs summarizes the currently available tests and their advantages and disadvantages. A combination of acute and convalescent MAT titers and PCR assays on blood (early stages of disease) or urine (later stages of disease) is recommended.  Table Comparison of Tests Used to Diagnose Leptospirosis in Dogs Treatment of Leptospirosis in Dogs Supportive care, together with specific antimicrobial therapy  Doxycycline to eliminate both the leptospiremic and carrier phases of infection  Supportive measures for acute kidney injury and liver disease might include: fluid therapy, with electrolyte supplementation as necessary; correction of acid-base disorders; antiemetics; phosphate binders; hepatic support medications; or appetite stimulants.  Renal replacement therapy with intermittent hemodialysis or continuous renal replacement therapy should be considered for dogs that are anuric or oliguric despite appropriate supportive therapy. Antimicrobial therapy is indicated whenever leptospirosis is suspected and should be instituted before confirmatory test results are available. There are limited case reports in dogs, but no experimental studies, to guide selection of antimicrobial protocols for this species.  Current recommendations are to treat with doxycycline (5 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours, for 2 weeks). For dogs that cannot tolerate doxycycline, initial therapy with a penicillin is appropriate; however, this course of therapy should be followed by a 2-week course of doxycycline treatment to eliminate the renal carrier phase of infection. Enrofloxacin or clarithromycin might also be used to eliminate the carrier phase. Dogs recently exposed to leptospirosis can be treated prophylactically with oral administration of doxycycline for 14 days.  Prevention of Leptospirosis in Dogs Commercial bacterins for dogs are available for serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, and Pomona in the US. It is not known whether vaccinated dogs are susceptible to infection with other serovars, although there is some experimental evidence for cross-protection. In general, currently available vaccines provide good protection from disease for at least one year, and also reduce renal colonization and urine shedding. Concerns exist regarding hypersensitivity reactions after leptospiral vaccination in dogs; however, vaccination against Leptospira (an organism that can cause fatal disease) is safe in most cases and studies have shown no significant increase in hypersensitivity reactions, compared with other vaccinations. Adverse reaction are perhaps associated with the use of more highly purified vaccines. Prior recommendations for vaccinating every 6 months are also no longer justified.

Zoonotic Risk of Leptospirosis in Dogs Because leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease, all veterinary personnel should take appropriate precautions when handling known or suspected infected animals. Such dogs do not need to be placed in isolation; however, they should be nursed with barrier precautions, paying particular attention to avoiding exposure of skin or mucous membranes to urine or blood. Infected dogs should be allowed to urinate in designated areas that can subsequently be cleaned and disinfected. The organisms are killed by all commonly used disinfectants. Owners of dogs recently diagnosed with canine leptospirosis should be advised of the zoonotic nature of the disease and contact their physicians with any health concerns. Owners should wear gloves when cleaning up urine and should wash their hands after handling the dog, at least until the course of antimicrobial therapy is completed.  Key Points Leptospirosis is a zoonotic disease found in multiple wild and domestic species, including dogs, and often transmitted by direct contact with urine or other body fluids of an infected host, although environmental contamination by urine can lead to transmission if conditions are suitable.  Diagnosis is by serologic testing, along with one or more methods to identify the organism in tissues or body fluids.  The treatment of choice is doxycycline, with appropriate supportive care as needed. Other antimicrobials, such as enrofloxacin, may also be effective. Vaccines can be used for prevention. Multistrain vaccines that include locally prevalent serovars should be used.  Zoonotic infections are not common; however, occupational exposure is a risk factor. The principle route of transmission is by contact with infectious body fluids. Lyme Borreliosis in Animals (Lyme Disease) ByNadine A. Vogt, BSc (Hons), DVM, MSc, University of Guelph Reviewed/Revised Mar 2021 | Modified Jun 2025 View the Pet Owner Version Lyme borreliosis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease transmitted by ticks infected with spirochetal bacteria belonging to the genus Borrelia. Affected dogs typically present with intermittent, lameness, fever, inappetance, lethargy, and focal lymphadenopathy. Although infrequently reported, clinical manifestations in horses include neurologic abnormalities, uveitis, and cutaneous lymphoma. Diagnosis is based on a combination of history, clinical signs, laboratory findings, exclusion of other diseases, and response to treatment. Treatment consists of an extended (eg, 30-day) course of antibiotics, supportive measures including analgesia, and immunosuppressive therapy in the case of autoimmune reaction.

Many additional mammalian and avian species become infected but do not develop overt clinical signs. This disease is endemic to temperate areas in the northern hemisphere and is seen sporadically in Europe and Asia. Within the USA, endemic areas include the Northeast (particularly the New England states), the upper Midwest, and the Pacific coast. Globally, the incidence of Lyme borreliosis is increasing due to the expanding geographic range of tick vectors.  Diagnosis can be challenging, because most animals do not develop clinical illness after infection. Clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis have been well documented in dogs, in which the characteristic presentation includes an intermittent, shifting lameness. Horses with Lyme borreliosis may exhibit neurologic signs, uveitis, or cutaneous lymphoma. Although other clinical signs such as lameness have been reported in horses, they have yet to be conclusively linked to infection. Along with prevention, early diagnosis and treatment with antibiotics appear to be important to treatment success.  Etiology and Transmission of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals Lyme borreliosis is caused by infection with spirochetal bacteria belonging to the Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato species complex. Within this complex, the following spirochete species are well-established causes of Lyme borreliosis in people: B burgdorferi sensu stricto (North America, Europe), B mayonii (North America), B afzelii (Europe, Asia), B bavariensis (Europe, Asia), and B garinii (Europe, Asia). The predominant species responsible for Lyme borreliosis in animals is B burgdorferi sensu stricto (henceforth B burgdorferi). It is unclear whether other Borrelia species within the sensu lato complex can cause Lyme borreliosis in animals. Tick vectors of B burgdorferi sensu lato are hard-shelled Ixodes ticks. In the USA, I scapularis (colloquially known as the deer tick) is the predominant vector in the Northeast and Midwest, whereas I pacificus is the predominant vector on the Pacific coast. In Europe and Asia, I ricinus and I persulcatus are the primary vectors.  Developmental stages of Ixodes spp   Image Courtesy of Dr. Reinhard K. Straubinger.  Ticks become infected with spirochetes on having a blood meal from a Borrelia-carrying host. A variety of wildlife species act as reservoir hosts for B burgdorferi. Rodents in particular are a major reservoir for Borrelia species. Infection rates of the vectors vary according to region and season and can be as high as 50% in adult ticks. Transmission is most likely to occur during warmer months of the year, when ticks are most active. However, transmission is also possible during the winter, because ticks may be active as long as temperatures are >4°C (40°F). After tick attachment, at least 24 hours are required for the transmission of spirochetes from the infected tick into the host, and transmission usually occurs 36–48 hours into the blood meal. Early removal of attached ticks, therefore, reduces the likelihood of spirochete transmission. B burgdorferi sensu lato organisms are not transmitted by insects, bodily fluids (urine, saliva, semen), or bite wounds. Experimental studies have shown that dams infected before gestation may transmit spirochetes to their pups in utero.  Clinical Findings of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals Numerous clinical syndromes have been attributed to Lyme borreliosis in domestic animals, including limb and joint disease, as well as renal, neurologic, and cardiac abnormalities. However, the clinical syndromes seen in different animal species vary considerably. Certain clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis are well documented in horses and dogs.  Although cats can become infected with B burgdorferi and mount an antibody response, it is unknown whether they develop subsequent clinical disease.  In dogs, the most common clinical signs are intermittent, shifting lameness, fever, anorexia, lethargy, and lymphadenopathy with or without swollen, painful joints.  Additionally, a renal syndrome has been attributed to B burgdorferi infection in dogs, though a causal relationship has yet to be established. This renal syndrome is characterized by uremia, hyperphosphatemia, and severe protein-losing nephropathy, often accompanied by peripheral edema. It is thought to be immune-mediated, and dogs typically present with either acute or chronic kidney failure, with or without additional cardiac or neurologic signs (eg, blindness, hypertension, heart murmurs, thromboembolic events).  In horses, well-documented clinical signs of Lyme borreliosis include neuroborreliosis, uveitis, and cutaneous lymphoma. Horses with neuroborreliosis may exhibit any of the following clinical signs: atrophy of spinal muscles, dysphagia, laryngeal dysfunction, facial paresis, spinal cord ataxia and paresis, behavioral changes, and hyperesthesia. Horses with neuroborreliosis may also exhibit clinical signs common to other neurologic disorders (eg, meningitis, cranial nerve dysfunction). Other clinical signs in horses, such as intermittent, shifting lameness, have not been conclusively linked to Lyme borreliosis.  Most seropositive dogs and horses are asymptomatic. This stands in contrast to people, in whom infection with B burgdorferi causes illness in an estimated 90% of people. Soon after infection via a tick bite, most individuals develop a characteristic bull's-eye rash (erythema migrans) at the site of infection, and some experience flu-like symptoms. Common signs and symptoms of Lyme borreliosis in people include arthritis with severe joint pain and swelling, facial paralysis, dizziness, heart palpitations, nerve pain, and severe headaches.  Diagnosis of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals Based on a combination of history, clinical signs, laboratory data, response to therapy, and exclusion of other diseases  Serology is important, but positive results have a low positive predictive value of clinical disease  Culture and PCR do not reliably detect spirochetes  Cytology and histopathology of affected tissues may show characteristic inflammatory changes  A diagnosis of Lyme borreliosis is generally reached through the exclusion of other diseases, in tandem with a history of exposure to ticks, clinical signs, supporting laboratory data, and response to therapy. Because clinical signs are nonspecific, other diseases may mimic the signs of Lyme borreliosis. Moreover, most infected animals are asymptomatic, so a positive test result for B burgdorferi has a low positive predictive value for clinical disease. In other words, a positive test neither demonstrates that current clinical signs are caused by infection with B burgdorferi, nor suggests that the animal is likely to develop clinical illness in the future. Thus, a positive test result in a clinically ill animal may be an incidental finding.  A number of infectious agents may be transmitted by ticks (eg, Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, Babesia, Rickettsia), some of which can cause clinical signs similar to those of Lyme borreliosis. Thus, infection with these agents, or mixed infections with B burgdorferi, should be considered. Anaplasma phagocytophilum, for example, is also transmitted by Ixodes ticks and can cause clinical signs resembling those of Lyme borreliosis in dogs and horses. In addition to excluding infectious causes, orthopedic disorders (eg, trauma, immune-mediated diseases) should be excluded as well.  Autoimmune panels, CBC, serum chemistry, radiographs, and other laboratory data are generally normal, except for results pertaining directly to the affected system (eg, soft-tissue swelling in limbs, neutrophil accumulation in synovial fluids of affected joints). Serologic testing for antibodies specific for B burgdorferi sensu lato is an adjunct to clinical diagnosis. Antibodies can be detected with ELISA (which test for C6 peptide) and with multiplex fluorescence assays. Because of possible cross-reactions with other spirochetal infections, the following serologic testing methods are no longer recommended: whole cell ELISA, immunofluorescent antibody assays, and Western blot.  The standard procedure for antibody detection is a two-tiered approach in which samples are screened with a sensitive rapid assay (ELISA or multiplex fluorescence) and only positively reacting samples are rechecked with specific confirmatory tests. Although quantitative antibody assays are available to test for C6, titer magnitude is a poor predictor of current or future illness.  Some vaccines can interfere with serologic tests, in particular, those that stimulate production of OspC (outer surface protein C) antibodies. Antibodies against C6 peptide, VlsE (variable major protein-like sequence, expressed), and OspF (outer surface protein F) indicate natural exposure, because these antigens are not contained in any vaccines. False-negative serologic results may occur in the case of an acute infection (< 1 month), infection of an immune-privileged site (eg, eye), or an abnormal host response (ie, immunodeficiency). In particular, horses with neuroborreliosis are often found to be seronegative.  Isolation of B burgdorferi sensu lato by culture or detection of specific DNA by PCR from joints, skin tissue samples, or other affected tissues may also help in diagnosis. Direct detection of the organism, however, is difficult and time-consuming (up to 6 weeks for culture) and yields negative results in most cases. Blood samples are generally negative, because the organism resides in tissue and not in the circulation. Characteristic inflammatory changes seen in histologic or cytologic samples of affected tissues may also be used to support a diagnosis.  Treatment of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals A long course of antibiotics (4 weeks) is indicated to treat infection in clinically ill animals  Symptomatic therapy should be directed toward the affected organ system and toward pain management  Immunosuppressive therapy is indicated in the case of infection-related autoimmune reactions  Some animals may remain seropositive after successful treatment  Antibiotic therapy is indicated in all animals with clinical signs attributed to Lyme borreliosis. Treatment of healthy seropositive animals is problematic because of the inability to monitor response to treatment and the potential for adverse drug effects. Antimicrobials in the tetracycline and beta-lactam families have been shown to be effective in treating Lyme borreliosis in dogs and horses. A long course of antibiotics (4 weeks) is indicated. Chronic infection in dogs and horses is not well documented, so the utility or efficacy of treatment beyond 4 weeks is unknown. Symptomatic therapy directed toward the affected organ system and clinicopathologic abnormalities is also important.  In dogs, doxycycline (10 mg/kg, PO, every 12 hours) and amoxicillin (20 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours) are effective, and a rapid response (1–3 days) to treatment is seen in most cases, although incomplete or transient resolution of signs occurs in a significant number of affected animals. Doxycycline is preferred over penicillins because mixed infections with other tick-borne pathogens are often found in animals with clinical signs. Symptomatic treatment for neuropathic pain may be indicated, in which case gabapentin is the recommended therapy; NSAIDs are less preferable because a wash-out period is required if the animal subsequently develops immune-mediated disease and requires immunosuppressive therapy. In dogs with kidney failure that is suspected to be related to Borrelia infection, supportive therapy is indicated, and immunosuppressive agents such as mycophenolate may be required for severe, rapidly progressing cases.  In horses, a number of tetracycline (administered orally and parenterally) and beta-lactam (administered parenterally) antibiotics have been successful in treating Lyme borreliosis. Treatment is more challenging in horses because of the poor bioavailability of antibiotics and because horses are often diagnosed long after they have been infected. Four-week courses of doxycycline (10 mg/kg, PO, twice a day) or minocycline (4 mg/kg, PO, twice a day) have reportedly been successful in treating Lyme borreliosis in horses. Although beta-lactams may be less practical because of parenteral administration and carry a risk of toxicity, they are preferable for treatment of neuroborreliosis. In these cases, parenteral high-dose penicillin (44,000 U/kg, IV, every 4–6 hours) or cefotaxime (25–50 mg/kg, IV, every 6–8 hours) may be useful. Certain antimicrobials (eg, ceftriaxone) have resulted in a high incidence of adverse effects in horses and should not be used.  Quantitative C6 antibody assays are sometimes performed before and after treatment to monitor response to therapy, although titers do not always decrease after treatment, and some animals remain seropositive. Successful treatment is therefore focused on the resolution of clinical signs rather than serologic data. An increased titer after treatment may represent a relapse or reinfection.  Control and Prevention of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals Tick Removal   Image Courtesy of Dr. Nadine A. Vogt.  Tick avoidance plays an important role in the control of Lyme borreliosis. A number of effective repellents and acaricides in collars, sprays, and spot-ons are available for use in dogs. Tick checks and prompt removal of ticks can reduce the likelihood of transmission, because at least 24 hours are required for transmission of spirochetes from tick to host. Ticks must be removed carefully. If the tick mouth parts are damaged and left in the animal, transmission of spirochetes may still occur, even after the tick has been removed.  A number of bacterin and recombinant vaccines are also licensed for use in dogs. Reported efficacies are variable (50%–100%), and evaluation of efficacy is challenging because of the lack of a disease model. The duration of immunity is 1 year. Dogs that have been exposed to ticks should be tested serologically for established infection before vaccination. Postinfection vaccination has little to no therapeutic effect on established infections.  Zoonotic Risk of Lyme Borreliosis in Animals Lyme borreliosis is a vector-borne zoonotic disease. Ticks transmit spirochetes from wildlife reservoirs to people. Companion and farm animals are not a reservoir, though they may harbor unattached infected ticks that can subsequently attach to a person and transmit spirochetes.  Key Points Lyme borreliosis is a bacterial, tick-transmitted disease of animals (dogs, horses, possibly cats) and people.  Transmission of Borrelia burgdorferi occurs during the blood meal of Ixodes spp ticks, and ticks may be active anytime temperatures are >4°C (40°F).  Dogs typically present with intermittent, shifting lameness, whereas horses may present with neurologic signs and/or uveitis.  Diagnosis is based on a combination of history of tick exposure, clinical signs, laboratory data, response to therapy, and exclusion of other diseases.  Clinically ill animals should be treated with a long course (4 weeks) of antibiotics (eg, doxycycline), and symptomatic therapy is used to manage pain and other conditions. Immunosuppressive therapy may be needed if an autoimmune reaction occurs.  The following preventive measures are available to reduce the risk of Lyme borreliosis: tick avoidance, prompt removal of ticks, acaricides, and vaccines.  In terms of zoonotic risk, companion and farm animals are not a direct source of infection but may harbor unattached infected ticks that can attach to people. Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Related Infections in Animals ByJanet E. Foley, DVM, PhD, Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis Reviewed/Revised Jul 2020 | Modified Sept 2024 Ehrlichiosis is a tick-transmitted disease that infects blood cells and can cause a variety of signs from none to fever and generalized achiness to possible fatality. Several species of bacteria cause ehrlichiosis, and some of the species infect humans as well as animals such as dogs. Diagnosis is based on signs, serology, and PCR. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Etiology | Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Prevention | Zoonotic Risk | Key Points | For More Information  Ehrlichiosis is an infection caused by obligate, intracellular bacteria that primarily affect cells of the immune system in dogs, cats, and people. In the past, the causative organisms were classified in the genus Ehrlichia on morphologic and ecologic grounds. With newer genetic analyses, these agents have been reclassified into the genera of Ehrlichia, Anaplasma, and Neorickettsia, all of which are in the family Anaplasmataceae. However, the term “ehrlichiosis” is still sometimes used to broadly describe these infections.  Etiology of Ehrlichiosis in Animals Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis is caused by Ehrlichia canis, which predominantly involves monocytes; although it is not considered a primary zoonosis, human infection with this agent has been occasionally reported. The closely related pathogen E chaffeensis causes human monocytic ehrlichiosis in the USA. Human cases are reported throughout the mid to southeastern and central USA.  Several published reports of monocytic ehrlichiosis in cats suggest that feline infection may occur, albeit uncommonly. E ewingii, which primarily infects the granulocytes of susceptible hosts, has been isolated from dogs and people in the southern, western, and midwestern USA. In 2009, an organism either identical or related to E muris (a pathogen of rodents) was identified as a cause of human illness in the upper Midwest; the role of this E muris–like (EML) agent as a possible pathogen of dogs or cats is currently unknown.  A phagocytophilum, formerly known as both E equi and the agent of human granulocytic ehrlichiosis, causes illness in dogs and horses. It also causes human illness in the USA, primarily in northeastern, upper midwestern, and western states. Infection with this agent is most appropriately referred to as anaplasmosis, and the pathogen is found predominantly in granulocytes.  A platys, which infects platelets, is the cause of infectious cyclic thrombocytopenia of dogs.  Epidemiology of Ehrlichiosis in Animals E canis is transmitted by the brown dog tick, Rhipicephalus sanguineus, which is found worldwide; accordingly, canine monocytic ehrlichiosis also has a worldwide distribution. Acute E canis cases in dogs may resemble infection with Rickettsia rickettsii (the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, which can also be transmitted by the brown dog tick). Rhipicephalus ticks become infected with E canis after feeding on infected dogs, and ticks transmit infection to other dogs during blood meals taken in successive life stages. Blood transfusions, or other means by which infected WBCs can be transferred, may also transmit the pathogen. E chaffeensis and E ewingii have sylvatic cycles in the environment that involve tick species and wildlife reservoir hosts.  In the USA, E chaffeensis and E ewingii are transmitted by Amblyomma americanum, the lone star tick. White-tailed deer are considered reservoir hosts for E chaffeensis and dogs are a probable reservoir for E ewingii. A case of human E ewingii contracted via blood infusion has been reported, and organ transplantation of E chaffeensis infection has been suspected. The ecologic cycle for the EML agent has not yet been elucidated but is suspected to involve Ixodes scapularis, the black-legged tick.  A phagocytophilum is transmitted by Ixodes species of ticks; in the northeastern USA, infection is transmitted by I scapularis, whereas infection in western states is primarily associated with I pacificus, the Western black-legged tick. In nature, the enzootic cycle is most likely associated with small rodents. People and domestic animals are incidental hosts of these pathogens. Human-to-human transmission via transfusion of packed RBCs has been reported; the risk of canine-associated infections after blood transfusion is unknown.  A platys is transmitted by R sanguineus and is enzootic in many parts of the USA and worldwide. Coinfection with E canis may occur, because the same tick vector is responsible for transmission of both pathogens.  Clinical Findings of Ehrlichiosis in Animals In dogs, E canis causes the most potentially severe clinical presentation of the Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp. Signs arise from involvement of the hemic and lymphoreticular systems; many dogs experience self-limiting infection, but some may develop a secondary quiescent phase of disease followed by a severe and life-threatening third chronic stage.  Clinical findings in acute ehrlichiosis include:  reticuloendothelial hyperplasia  fever  generalized lymphadenopathy  splenomegaly  thrombocytopenia  Variable signs of anorexia, depression, loss of stamina, stiffness and reluctance to walk, edema of the limbs or scrotum, and coughing or dyspnea may be seen. Most acute cases are seen in the warmer months, coincident with the greatest activity of the tick vector. Chronic cases may present at any time of year.  During the acute phase of E canis infection in dogs, the hemogram is usually normal but may reflect a mild normocytic, normochromic anemia; leukopenia; or mild leukocytosis. Thrombocytopenia is common, but petechiae may not be evident, and platelet decreases may be mild in some animals. Lymph node aspiration reveals hyperplasia. Death is rare during this phase; spontaneous recovery may occur, the dog may remain asymptomatic, or chronic disease may ensue.  Chronic ehrlichiosis caused by E canis may develop in any breed, but certain breeds, eg, German Shepherds, may be predisposed. Seasonality is not a specific hallmark of chronic infection, because appearance of chronic signs may be variably delayed after acute infection. In chronic cases, the bone marrow becomes hypoplastic, and lymphocytes and plasmacytes infiltrate various organs. Vasculitis and immune-mediated mechanisms induce a thrombocytopenia and a risk of bleeding.  Clinical findings of chronic ehrlichiosis based on the predominant organs affected and may include:  marked splenomegaly  glomerulonephritis  renal failure  interstitial pneumonitis  anterior uveitis  meningitis (with associated cerebellar ataxia, depression, paresis, and hyperesthesia)  severe weight loss  The hemogram is usually markedly abnormal in chronic cases. Severe thrombocytopenia may cause epistaxis, hematuria, melena, and petechiae and ecchymoses of the skin. Variably severe pancytopenia (mature leukopenia, nonregenerative anemia, thrombocytopenia, or any combination thereof) may be seen. Aspiration cytology reveals reactive lymph nodes and, usually, marked plasmacytosis. Frequently, polyclonal, or occasionally monoclonal, hypergammaglobulinemia develops.  Other ehrlichial infections caused by E chaffeensis, E ewingii, or A phagocytophilum appear clinically similar to acute E canis infection, but the clinical course is usually milder and more self-limiting. Thrombocytopenia and mild leukopenia or leukocytosis may occur during the acute course of infection. Chronic canine disease, as seen with E canis infection, is not typically seen with other infections.  Dogs infected with A platys generally show minimal to no signs of infection despite the presence of the organism in platelets. The primary finding is cyclic thrombocytopenia, recurring at 10-day intervals. Generally, the cyclic nature diminishes, and the thrombocytopenia becomes mild and slowly resolves.  Lesions During the acute or self-limiting phase of E canis infections, lesions generally are nonspecific, but splenomegaly is common. Histologically, there is lymphoreticular hyperplasia and lymphocytic and plasmacytic perivascular cuffing. In chronic cases, these lesions may be accompanied by widespread hemorrhage and increased mononuclear cell infiltration in perivascular regions of many organs.  Diagnosis of Ehrlichiosis in Animals Based on clinical signs, serology, and PCR  Because hematologic abnormalities are common findings with ehrlichiosis infections, a CBC is an important screening test. Infected animals often have thrombocytopenia. The clinical diagnosis may be confirmed by demonstrating the organisms within WBCs or platelets, seen in intracytoplasmic inclusion bodies called morulae. This method of diagnosis lacks sensitivity, because low numbers of organisms make demonstration difficult. However, requesting a smear of concentrated buffy coat and examining the feathered edges of blood slides can improve sensitivity.  Serologic tests for ehrlichiosis are available based on enzyme immunoassays and immunofluorescent antibodies. The IgG antibody response to infection may be delayed for several weeks, and IgM titers can be low; thus, serology may be negative early in the course of the disease. Furthermore, antibodies can persist for months or years after infection, making serology problematic for diagnosis of clinically significant infection, particularly in highly enzootic areas where many dogs may have antibodies to these agents because of previous infections.  Testing of paired sera and demonstration of four-fold increased antibody titers is recommended to confirm infection when possible, although treatment of suspected cases should never be delayed or withheld on the basis of test results. Serologic cross-reactivity is strong among E canis, E chaffeensis, and E ewingii, and among A phagocytophilum and A platys. In people, the EML agent shows cross-reactivity to E chaffeensis. In some areas, ~50% of dogs infected with E canis also have a titer to A platys, which likely reflects coinfection; cross-reactivity between these agents is not seen.  Serologic testing may be done using in-house point-of-care tests and by sending blood to local diagnostic laboratories. Testing is often offered as part of \"panels\" for tickborne disease, and considerable care is required to interpret positive serology for one or more pathogens in light of compatible clinical illness.  PCR detects specific Ehrlichia and Anaplasma species in infected people and animals. Samples appropriate for PCR include blood, tissue aspirates, or biopsy specimens of reticuloendothelial organs, such as lymph nodes, spleen, liver, or bone marrow. PCR can also be used to detect the effectiveness of treatment in clearing infection although false-positive testing can occur briefly after treatment because the target for the test is DNA, which may remain at a site even after the pathogen has been killed. PCR is increasingly available through commercial veterinary laboratories as well as at veterinary schools and research institutions. PCR is also available through several commercial human laboratories.  Differential diagnoses for ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis include:  Acute stage:  Rocky Mountain spotted fever  brucellosis  blastomycosis  endocarditis  systemic lupus erythematosus  lymphosarcoma  Chronic stage:  estrogen toxicity  myelophthisis  immune-mediated pancytopenia  multisystemic diseases associated with specific organ dysfunction (eg, glomerulonephritis)  Treatment of Ehrlichiosis in Animals Doxycycline is the treatment of choice  Supportive care may be needed, especially for chronic cases  To treat infection with Ehrlichia and Anaplasma spp, the drug of choice is doxycycline because of its superior intracellular penetration and bacteriostatic properties against rickettsiae. Doxycycline is recommended for dogs of all ages. If infection is suspected, dogs should be treated empirically; treatment should not be withheld or delayed pending laboratory results. Early seronegative tests should not be considered a reason to stop therapy, because antibodies may take ≥1 week to develop in acute cases.  Recommended drug dosages for treatment of ehrlichiosis are:  Doxycycline: 5 mg/kg every 12 hours, or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours, PO or IV, for at least 28 days. Minocycline may be substituted if doxycycline is unavailable.  Tetracycline: 22 mg/kg, PO, three times a day (≥2 weeks, acute cases, 1–2 months, chronic cases)  Imidocarb diproprionate: 2 doses, 5–7 mg/kg, IM, 2 weeks apart (also effective for some strains of babesiosis)  In acute cases receiving appropriate antibiotic therapy, body temperature is expected to return to normal within 24–48 hours after treatment. In chronic cases associated with E canis infection, the hematologic abnormalities may persist for 3–6 months, although clinical response to treatment often occurs much sooner. If a dog is thought to have chronic ehrlichiosis, the E canis antibody titer and whole blood PCR should be repeated after 6 months of illness to confirm successful therapy. Serum titers that persist at lower but positive levels should be rechecked in another 6 months to ensure they are not increasing.  Supportive therapy may be necessary in animals with high fever or those with chronic disease complicated by wasting and specific organ dysfunction. NSAIDs and appropriate fluid therapy may help reduce fever. Animals with anemia or severe thrombocytopenia should be treated with platelet or whole-blood transfusions as appropriate, particularly if hemorrhage is extensive. Concurrent broad-spectrum antibiotics may be needed if a dog has severe leukopenia.  Prevention of Ehrlichiosis in Animals Prevention of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis is accomplished by controlling ticks on dogs. Dogs in areas infested by ticks should be limited from walking off-trail, in certain grassy areas, and where there may be ticks in some leaf litter. They should be examined after walks, with ticks removed carefully (to prevent human exposure), although it is unrealistic that owners will find all ticks in the coat of a dog. Multiple topical medications are available to prevent tick bites, and these should be used in compliance with labeling before bringing dogs into areas infested with ticks. Because R sanguineus infestations can be problematic in kennels and around homes, and longterm tick control is needed for management, use of effective long-acting collars on all susceptible dogs might be considered; collars containing propoxur, amitraz, or flumethrin have proven activity against R sanguineus.  Prevention of transfusion-associated transmission can be reduced by using seronegative screened blood donors, although new donors with a negative screen cannot be presumed free of infection for several weeks because they may be incubating infection. Prophylactic administration of tetracycline at a lower dosage (6.6 mg/kg/day, PO) is effective in preventing E canis infection in kennels where disease is endemic. Treatment must be extended for many months through at least one tick season if the endemic cycle is to be successfully eliminated, and tick control should be implemented as well.  Zoonotic Risk of Ehrlichiosis E chaffeensis, E ewingii, and A phagocytophilum are considered zoonoses. Despite the occurrence of disease in both animals and people, the involvement of a required intermediate tick vector for transmission means dogs and other infected animals do not pose a direct transmission risk in normal circumstances. Infection in dogs may indicate a heightened risk of human infections related to tick exposure in a given area.  Key Points Multiple ehrlichioses and anaplasmoses may be transmitted by ticks from wildlife to pets and people (or from dog to dog in the case of canine monocytic ehrlichiosis).  Ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis have similar clinical manifestations, with acute fever and hematologic abnormalities.  Maintaining an index of suspicion for infection based on known tick activity, and using appropriate diagnostic testing, are important to make diagnoses of ehrlichiosis and anaplasmosis and to implement effective treatment.

IN THIS TOPIC OTHER TOPICS IN THIS CHAPTER Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Related Infections in Animals Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Murine Typhus in Animals Salmon Poisoning Disease and Elokomin Fluke Fever in Animals  logo PROFESSIONAL VERSION Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs (Rickettsia rickettsii Infection) ByJanet E. Foley, DVM, PhD, Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis Reviewed/Revised Jul 2020 | Modified Sept 2024 Spotted fevers are diseases caused by a set of related bacteria in the Rickettsia genus, of which Rocky Mountain spotted fever is the most severe. After transmission of the pathogen through tick bite, patients may manifest a local eschar or characteristic rash, including petechial hemorrhage and other clinical outcomes of vasculitis. Diagnosis is by clinical signs and serology. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice. Etiology | Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Zoonotic Risk | Key Points | For More Information  Etiology of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Rocky Mountain spotted fever (RMSF) is a disease of people and dogs caused by Rickettsia rickettsii. R rickettsii and closely related members of the spotted fever group of rickettsiae are in parts of North, South, and Central America. These pathogens are transmitted primarily through the bites of infected ticks. Among the numerous related Rickettsia species, R rickettsii's ability to infect dogs is best-documented. The ability of genetically similar rickettsial organisms, such as R parkeri, to cause clinically similar disease in dogs is unknown. Because of their susceptibility to R rickettsii and relatively higher rates of tick exposure, dogs may serve as excellent sentinels of risk for R rickettsii infection in people. Clusters of disease are frequently reported in defined geographic areas, and temporally associated infections may be seen both in dogs and their owners.  Epidemiology of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs In the USA, Dermacentor variabilis (the American dog tick) and D andersoni (the Rocky Mountain wood tick) have been considered the primary vectors for R rickettsii, which is most common in North America is southeastern states in the USA. In South America, several Amblyomma spp of ticks have been implicated in transmission. Rhipicephalus sanguineus ticks (the brown dog tick) are the primary vector in some focal areas of Arizona, particularly on native American tribal lands. R sanguineus ticks are also associated with transmission of R rickettsii in Central America and with large, city-based outbreaks in Mexico.  The pathogen is acquired by larval and nymph stages of ticks while feeding on infected vertebrate hosts and is also passed from female ticks to progeny through transovarial transmission. Typically, very few individual ticks (eg, < 1% of Dermacentor spp ticks) carry R rickettsii, even in areas considered highly endemic. However, in highly enzootic regions of Arizona where R rickettsii is transmitted by the brown dog tick, as many as 5% of ticks may be infected.  Seroprevalence in dogs from endemic areas ranges from 4.3%–77%, but these values do not accurately reflect infection rates antirickettsial antibodies may cross-react among genetically similar rickettsiae. RMSF transmission through blood transfusion has been documented in a human case and should be considered when selecting canine blood donors. Direct transmission from dogs to people has not been reported, although human infection may occur after contact of abraded skin or conjunctiva with tick hemolymph or excreta during removal of engorged ticks from pets.  Clinical Findings in Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Dogs are highly susceptible to clinical infection with R rickettsii; in contrast, it is rarely diagnosed in cats. Early signs in dogs may include:  fever (up to 105°F [40.5°C])  anorexia  lymphadenopathy  polyarthritis  coughing or dyspnea  abdominal pain  vomiting and diarrhea  edema of the face or extremities  Petechial hemorrhages of the conjunctiva and oral mucosa may be seen in severe cases. Focal retinal hemorrhage may be seen during the early course of disease. Neurologic manifestations such as altered mental states, vestibular dysfunction, and paraspinal hyperesthesia may occur.  Thrombocytopenia is common. Leukopenia develops during the early stages of infection and, in untreated cases, is followed by progressive leukocytosis. Serum biochemical abnormalities may include hypoproteinemia, hypoalbuminemia, azotemia, hyponatremia, hypocalcemia, and increased liver enzyme activities. Case fatality rates of ~1%–10% are expected.  Lesions Vascular endothelial damage is due to direct cytopathic effects of the rickettsiae, which reproduce within endothelial cells. Vascular endothelial damage and thrombocytopenia contribute to development of petechiae and ecchymoses. Necrosis of the extremities (acryl gangrene) or disseminated intravascular coagulation can develop in severely affected dogs.  Diagnosis of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Based on clinical signs and serology  Dogs presenting with characteristic clinical signs of Rocky Mountain spotted fever, particularly fever or neurologic abnormalities, should be assessed for RMSF, and it is crucial to maintain an index of suspicion in areas where the tick vectors may be found. Differential diagnoses include other causes of fever of unknown origin; in areas where the brown dog tick is the main vector, most febrile dogs will likely be infected with Ehrlichia canis, which is more common than RMSF. Very early in infection, PCR of circulating blood may be positive, although many severely affected animals become PCR-negative as the bacteria become resident in endothelium. PCR of a tick-bite eschar can be useful when such a lesion is present. Suspect cases should be treated with appropriate antimicrobials without waiting for test confirmation, and the therapeutic response is usually dramatic, as it is in other canine rickettsial diseases.  Indirect fluorescent antibody titer (IFA) and ELISA are available for serologic testing. However, there is a high incidence of cross-reacting antibodies to a variety of non- and less-pathogenic spotted fever group rickettsiae, so a single seropositive test does not confirm RMSF as a cause of clinical disease. Dogs that have been sick for a week or more may develop very high titers, which can support a diagnosis, although antibodies may persist for months after acute RMSF infection. Demonstration of a 4-fold rise in titer over 2–4 weeks can retrospectively support that a dog has been infected with some type of Rickettsia.  Treatment of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Doxycycline is the treatment of choice  Antibiotic treatment for Rocky Mountain spotter fever should be administered based on clinical suspicion without waiting for results of serologic tests, because delayed administration of antibiotics may result in higher rates of severe or fatal outcome. Doxycycline is the treatment of choice, regardless of age of the dog, and should be administered at a dosage of 5 mg/kg every 12 hours, or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours, PO or IV, for 14–21 days. Tetracycline at 22 mg/kg, PO, every 8 hours for 14–21 days is also effective. Chloramphenicol has been used to treat RMSF in the past, but its use is associated with higher rates of fatal outcome in people, and it is not recommended. Other broad-spectrum antibiotics are ineffective against R rickettsii infection, and there is some evidence in human cases that use of fluoroquinolones may actually worsen infection.  Early seronegative tests should not be considered a reason to stop therapy, because antibodies may take ≥1 week to develop in acute cases. Supportive care for dehydration and hemorrhagic diathesis may be necessary. Because of alterations in vascular integrity, conservative rates of fluid administration are advised. Animals with neurologic dysfunction may have residual deficits. Immunity appears to be lifelong after natural infection; therefore, recurrent episodes should not be attributed to RMSF.  Precautions should be taken for the safe removal and control of ticks. In settings in which R rickettsii transmission from R sanguineus is suspected, medications and products with proven efficacy against this tick species are important to use. Because R sanguineus infestations can be problematic in kennels and around homes, and longterm tick control is needed for outbreak control, use of effective long-acting tick collars on all susceptible dogs might be considered; collars containing propoxur, amitraz, or flumethrin have proven activity against R sanguineus.  Zoonotic Risk of Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs R rickettsii is considered a zoonotic pathogen. The potential for household clustering and large urban outbreaks, particularly in areas with transmission by brown dog ticks, makes RMSF a disease of significant public health concern. Although clinical disease occurs both in animals and people, the involvement of a required intermediate tick vector for transmission means dogs and other infected animals do not pose a direct transmission risk in normal circumstances. Nevertheless, dogs are the main host for brown dog ticks, and overly abundant and stray dogs can increase overall risk for other dogs and people. Particularly in areas where transmission occurs via R sanguineus, close cooperation between veterinary, medical, and public health officials is important to achieve control.  Key Points Although there are multiple related Rickettsia species that can be transmitted to people, the most common in dogs and the most severe in people and dogs is Rickettsia rickettsii, the agent of Rocky Mountain spotted fever.  Infected dogs serve to increase risk for people and dogs where the vector is the brown dog tick, and in any region, the presence of infected dogs is a valuable sentinel for human risk.  RMSF causes disease primarily attributable to vasculitis and can be difficult to confirm as a diagnosis, requiring that clinicians know about the local prevalence, have an index of suspicion, and treat suspected cases as quickly as possible.

IN THIS TOPIC OTHER TOPICS IN THIS CHAPTER Ehrlichiosis, Anaplasmosis, and Related Infections in Animals Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever in Dogs Murine Typhus in Animals Salmon Poisoning Disease and Elokomin Fluke Fever in Animals  logo PROFESSIONAL VERSION Murine Typhus in Animals (Rickettsia typhi Infection, R felis Infection) ByJanet E. Foley, DVM, PhD, Department of Medicine and Epidemiology, School of Veterinary Medicine, University of California, Davis Reviewed/Revised Jul 2020 | Modified Sept 2024 Rickettsia typhi, the causative agent of murine typhus, and R felis are zoonotic pathogens maintained primarily in rodent reservoirs (rats, mice) that may also be associated with enzootic cycles involving opossums and domestic cats. Infection is transmitted to people and other animals through contact with infected fleas. Clinical signs in animals are not well documented. Diagnosis is based on serology and PCR. Doxycycline can be used for treatment if clinical signs are present. Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Zoonotic Risk | Key Points | For More Information  Epidemiology of Murine Typhus in Animals Murine typhus infection in people is primarily thought to occur through exposure of abraded skin with infectious flea feces; aerosolization of infectious materials may occur in limited settings. Dogs and cats are presumably exposed in a similar fashion. Known to occur worldwide, there are current foci of human cases of murine typhus in southern Texas, California, and Hawaii. The disease is thought to be underreported.  Clinical Findings in Murine Typhus in Animals Clinical illness associated with canine and feline infection with R typhi and R felis is not well documented, but evidence of exposure based on presence of antirickettsial antibodies has been noted, particularly in association with outbreaks of human disease.  Diagnosis of Murine Typhus in Animals Based on serology and PCR  An indirect fluorescent antibody (IFA) titer assessed in paired sera is preferred for serologic testing and is most commonly used in conjunction with environmental assessments around a human outbreak. There is cross-reactivity with antibodies from other rickettsial infections, including R rickettsii, so assessments should ideally be made with paired sera. PCR of whole blood may also be used, but its sensitivity in assessing canine and feline infection is poor because the animals may not exhibit clinical signs during periods of rickettsemia, making it difficult to determine the optimal time for assessment. PCR can also be run on fleas obtained from pets to guide in documenting presence of typhus agents.  Treatment of Murine Typhus in Animals Doxycycline can be used if clinical signs are present  In the absence of clinical signs, specific treatment is not recommended. If clinical illness associated with R typhi or R felis infection is suspected in a dog or cat, doxycycline may be administered at a dosage of 5 mg/kg every 12 hours, or 10 mg/kg every 24 hours, PO or IV, for 10–21 days. Animals should be provided with routine preventive treatments to control fleas. Control programs involving animal removal from an area of enzootic activity should be accompanied by pesticide treatment of the environment to prevent fleas feeding on people after the removal of preferred blood-meal hosts.  Zoonotic Risk of Murine Typhus R typhi is a zoonotic pathogen. Serologic evidence of exposure or past infection in dogs or cats is consistent with a heightened risk of human infections in a given area, although serology cannot pinpoint which rickettsial organism is present. Flea control for pets is an essential component of disease control. A role as a possible reservoir for infection has been suggested for cats; however rats and opossums are much more important hosts of the bacteria and sources of the infected fleas. Nonetheless, dogs and cats may, at a minimum, serve as a source of fleas that may pose a transmission risk to people. Regular flea control is recommended to reduce risk of flea-associated transmission to people.  Key Points Murine typhus is a flea-transmitted zoonosis that is concentrated in a few foci in several states in North America.  Companion animals show no or few signs of disease but can host fleas that can be a source of spillover infection in people.  Reducing exposure to rats, opossums, and fleas are all means to reduce risk of transmission of murine typhus to people.

The disease is characterized by fever, anorexia, weakness, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy, typically of cervical and mesenteric lymph nodes. Diagnosis is by serology, PCR, or finding trematode eggs in feces. The treatment of choice is doxycycline; without treatment, infection is fatal in 90% of dogs. Etiology | Epidemiology | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Prevention and Treatment | Key Points | For More Information Topic Resources Audios (0) Calculators (0) Images (4) Tables (0) Videos (0)  The name salmon poisoning disease (SPD) is misleading, because no toxin is involved. Elokomin fluke fever (EFF) is an acute infectious disease of canids, ferrets, bears, and raccoons that resembles SPD but has a wider host range. EFF is caused by ingestion of metacercaria infected with Neorickettsia elokominica encysting in a fish. The only way to distinguish SPD from EFF is PCR, using specific primer pairs. In people, N sennetsu causes a disease known as Sennetsu fever, reported from western Japan, Laos, and Malaysia. In horses, N risticii and a new Neorickettsia species cause a disease known as Potomac horse fever; these have not been reported as a cause of illness in dogs except for one report of N risticii in Illinois.  Salmon poisoning disease, small intestine, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Yasuko Rikihisa.  Salmon poisoning disease, trematode   Image Courtesy of Dr. Yasuko Rikihisa  Etiology of Salmon Poisoning Disease in Animals Salmon poisoning disease is caused by N helminthoeca and is sometimes complicated by a second agent, N elokominica, which causes EFF. The reservoir and vector for these Neorickettsia agents is a small fluke, Nanophyetus salmincola. N elokominica also infects other species of trematodes in other species of fish. Dogs and other animals become infected by ingesting trout, salmon, or Pacific giant salamanders that contain the encysted metacercaria stage of the Neorickettsia-infected fluke. In the dog’s intestine, the metacercarial flukes excyst, embed in the duodenal mucosa, become gravid adults, and transmit the rickettsiae to macrophages in intestinal mucosa and lymphatic tissues and blood monocytes. The fluke infection itself produces little or no clinical disease. SPD or most likely EFF in captive Malayan sun bears and reintroduced grizzly bears underscore the need to consider this etiology in nonnative species with compatible exposure and clinical histories.  Epidemiology of Salmon Poisoning Disease in Animals The life cycle of Neorickettsia helminthoeca is maintained by the release of infected fluke ova in the feces of the mammalian host. Infected miracidia develop from these ova and infect the snails Juga plicifera and Juga silicula to form infected rediae. Rediae develop into infected cercariae that are released from the snail, penetrate the salmon or trout, and develop into encysted metacercariae infected with Neorickettsia. The cycle is completed when mammals eat the fish, and infected metacercariae become infected gravid adults and pass Neorickettsia to fluke eggs. Although Neorickettsia infection of dogs is not required for the life cycle of Neorickettsia, mammalian infection is required to maintain the trematode life cycle. Transmission by cage-to-cage contact, rectal thermometers, or aerosols is rare.  There are no age, sex, or breed predilections; however, the disease prevalence is higher when the availability of trematode-infected fish is greater. Infected fish are found in the Pacific Ocean from San Francisco to the coast of Alaska, but SPD is more prevalent from northern California to Puget Sound. It is also seen inland along the rivers of fish migration. SPD also has been reported in southern California and Brazil. The snail is the primary factor for geographic limitation, but dogs fed undercooked or raw fish from the supermarket may have developed SPD.  Clinical Findings in Salmon Poisoning Disease in Animals In salmon poisoning disease, signs appear suddenly, usually 5–7 days after eating infected fish, but may be delayed as long as 33 days and persist for 7–10 days before culminating in death in up to 90% of untreated animals. Body temperature peaks at 104°–107.6°F (40°–42°C) 1–2 days later, then gradually declines for 4–8 days and returns to normal. Frequently, animals are hypothermic before death. Fever is accompanied by depression and complete anorexia in virtually all cases. Persistent vomiting usually occurs by day 4 or 5. Vomiting occurs in most cases, and diarrhea, which develops by day 5–7, often contains blood and may be severe. Dehydration and extreme weight loss occur. When severe, the GI signs are clinically indistinguishable from those of canine parvoviral infection. Generalized lymphadenopathy develops in ~60% of cases. Nasal or conjunctival exudate may be present and mimic signs of distemper. Neutrophilia is common, but a marked, absolute leukopenia with a degenerative left shift may occur. Thrombocytopenia is reported in 94% of the cases. Serum chemistry values are normal.  Clinically, EFF can be either milder or as severe as SPD. Severe GI signs are less commonly seen in EFF infections, and lymphadenopathy may be a more pronounced finding. Case fatality rates with EFF in dogs can be lower, at ~10% of untreated cases.  Lesions Neorickettsia helminthoeca, dog   Image Courtesy of Dr. Yasuko Rikihisa.  Infection appears to chiefly affect the lymphoid tissues and intestines. There is enlargement of the GI lymph follicles, lymph nodes, tonsils, thymus, and to some extent, the spleen, with microscopic necrosis, hemorrhage, and hyperplasia. Remarkable abdominal or mesenteric lymphadenomegaly may be seen. A variable but often severe nonhemorrhagic enteritis is seen throughout the intestine with SPD but is less commonly seen with EFF. Microscopic foci of necrosis also appear apart from the follicles. Nonsuppurative meningitis or meningoencephalitis has been identified in some dogs.  Salmon poisoning disease, gross pathology   Image Courtesy of Dr. Yasuko Rikihisa  Diagnosis of Salmon Poisoning Disease in Animals Serology, PCR, or finding trematode eggs in feces  Other causes of fever of unknown origin, generalized lymphadenopathy, vomiting, and diarrhea are differential diagnoses. When diarrhea and exudative conjunctivitis occur, distemper should be considered. Fluke ova are found on fecal examination in ~92% of cases, which supports the diagnosis. The ova are oval, yellowish brown, rough-surfaced, and ~87–97 × 35–55 mcm, with an indistinct operculum and a small, blunt point on the opposite end. During the first day or two, few ova may be passed. Intracellular organisms have been demonstrated by Romanowsky staining on lymph node aspirates in ~70% of cases.  Serologic tests using the N helminthoeca organism have been developed. These include an IFA using N helminthoeca-infected cultured cells as the antigen) and immunoblot assays using purified bacteria or recombinant N helminthoeca outer membrane proteins, P51, and/or strain‐variable surface antigen.  PCR testing to detect DNA specific to N helminthoeca (or pan-Neorickettsia species) is recommended for accurate diagnosis.  Prevention and Treatment of Salmon Poisoning Disease in Animals Treatment of choice is doxycycline  Treatment options include parenteral oxytetracycline (7 mg/kg, IV, three times a day for 5 days) or doxycycline (10 mg/kg, twice daily for 7 days). Oral tetracycline or doxycycline are contraindicated when GI signs are present. Sulfonamides are not effective and may worsen the clinical disease.  Animals usually succumb because of dehydration, electrolyte and acid-base imbalances, and anemia. Therefore, general supportive therapy to maintain hydration and acid-base balance, while meeting nutritional requirements and controlling diarrhea, is often essential. Judicious use of whole blood transfusions may be helpful.  Currently, the only means of prevention is to restrict the ingestion of uncooked salmon, trout, steelhead, and similar freshwater fish. In animals that recover, a profound humoral immune response persists, but there is no cross-resistance between N helminthoeca and N elokominica.  Key Points Salmon poisoning disease and Elokomin fluke fever are systemic infections caused in dogs and other canids and carnivores by Neorickettsia species found in flukes carried by freshwater fish.  The diseases are characterized by fever, anorexia, weakness, weight loss, and lymphadenopathy  Supportive care and parenteral oxytetracycline or doxycycline are the recommended treatments.  Prevention requires restricting access to uncooked fish. Canine Herpesvirus Infection ByKate E. Creevy, DVM, MS, DACVIM-SAIM, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A & M University; Jeremy B. Evans, DVM, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2022 | Modified Mar 2025 Canine herpesvirus infection is a systemic viral infection that affects puppies worldwide, with mortality rates often reaching 100% in affected litters. Clinical signs, though severe, are nonspecific and can include anorexia, weight loss, inappropriate vocalization, blindness, abdominal distention, dyspnea or tachypnea, and diarrhea. For neonatal infections, treatment consists of nonspecific supportive care. Etiology and Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Prevention | Key Points | For More Information  Canine herpesvirus is considered a potential cause of any acute neonatal puppy death or failure to thrive. No vaccine is available in the US. Because the disease progresses rapidly in susceptible neonates, antemortem diagnosis is difficult; it is possible, however, if clinical signs are recognized promptly and antibody or PCR assays are used. The disease is diagnosed most often during necropsy, via PCR assay and microscopy of affected tissues. For neonatal infections, treatment consists of nonspecific supportive care, but the overall prognosis is guarded to grave.  Clinically, neonatal canine herpesvirus is characterized by the following:  severe nonspecific systemic signs in a neonatal puppy  diarrhea, inappetence, lack of weight gain  tachypnea, pneumonia  corneal edema, conjunctivitis  lack of fever  rapidly progressive illness  failure to thrive or sudden death  Canine herpesvirus infection is best known as a severe viral infection of puppies; however, increasingly sensitive molecular diagnostics have enabled its recognition in adult dogs with upper respiratory infection, ocular disease, or vesicular vaginitis or posthitis, as well as in dogs with no clinical signs. As is typical of herpesviruses, recovery from clinical signs is associated with lifelong latent infection. Only canids (dogs, wolves, coyotes) are known to be susceptible. The seroprevalence in dog populations worldwide ranges from 20% to 98%, depending on the region and population studied. Because latently infected animals may transiently convert to seronegative status, any seroprevalence study likely underestimates the true rate of exposure and carriage.  Etiology and Pathogenesis of Canine Herpesvirus Infection Infectious canine herpesvirus is due to an enveloped DNA canine herpesvirus (CHV) that is relatively unstable outside the host, so close contact is required for transmission.  CHV is usually transmitted by contact between susceptible individuals and the infected oral, nasal, or vaginal secretions of shedding dogs. Many dogs shedding virus exhibit no clinical signs. Immunologically naive pregnant bitches are at risk of acute infection, which may be transmitted to fetuses or neonatal pups; previously infected bitches are unlikely to transmit infection. The most important systemic disease occurs in fetal or neonatal puppies as a result of in utero infection or infection in the first 3 weeks of life. After this time, natural resistance to infection improves as puppies mature and maintain a higher body temperature.  Infection of susceptible animals results in the replication of CHV in the surface cells of the nasal mucosa, pharynx, and tonsils. In newborn susceptible pups or other immunocompromised dogs, viremia arises and diverse visceral organs are invaded. Primary systemic infection is associated with copious viral shedding; shedding by latently infected animals after clinical or subclinical recrudescence is of lesser severity and duration.  Clinical Findings of Canine Herpesvirus Infection Because canine herpesvirus replicates more efficiently at the lower body temperatures maintained by neonates, deaths due to CHV infection occur usually in puppies 1–3 weeks old, occasionally in puppies up to 1 month old, and rarely in pups as old as 6 months. Typically, onset is sudden, and death occurs after an illness of ≤ 24 hours. If clinical signs are observed, they may include lethargy, decreased suckling, diarrhea, nasal discharge, conjunctivitis, corneal edema, erythematous rash, oral or genital vesicles (rarely), and the notable absence of fever. Thoracic radiographs show a diffuse unstructured interstitial pattern that is typical of viral pneumonitis; in contrast to other viral diseases of puppies, however, leukocytosis may be present.  Older dogs exposed to or experimentally inoculated with CHV may develop mild upper respiratory tract signs, which may be part of the kennel cough syndrome (infectious tracheobronchitis). They may also develop vesicular vaginitis or posthitis. Conjunctivitis and dendritic corneal ulcers have also been reported in the absence of other upper respiratory signs. Acutely infected pregnant bitches may abort a litter or deliver a partially stillborn litter; however, they seldom exhibit other clinical signs, and future breeding is likely to be successful.  Lesions The characteristic gross lesions of CHV infection at necropsy consist of disseminated focal necrosis and hemorrhages. The most pronounced lesions occur in the lungs, cortical portion of the kidneys, adrenal glands, liver, and GI tract. All lymph nodes are enlarged and hyperemic, and the spleen is swollen. Lesions may also be found in the eyes and CNS. The basic histologic lesion is necrosis, with hemorrhage in the adjacent parenchyma. The inflammatory reaction in many organs may be limited; however, marked neutrophilic and mononuclear infiltration is observed in ocular lesions. Single, small, basophilic, intranuclear inclusion bodies are most common in areas of necrosis in the lung, liver, and kidneys; occasionally, they are evident as faintly acidophilic bodies located within the nuclear space.  Diagnosis of Canine Herpesvirus Infection Clinical evaluation  Serologic testing  Clinical signs of canine herpesvirus infection are often nonspecific. Any neonatal puppy that suddenly dies or is systemically ill without the presence of a fever should be considered a potential case of CHV. Older dogs with mild respiratory or ocular signs may also be infected. Prompt clinical recognition of CHV is needed to achieve antemortem diagnosis. Antibody ELISA or PCR assays can be used to confirm the diagnosis.  Necropsy of one deceased puppy in an affected litter may be the most efficient diagnostic strategy. In systemically affected puppies, CHV infection may be confused with infectious canine hepatitis; however, it is not accompanied by the thickened, edematous gallbladder often associated with the latter. The focal areas of necrosis and hemorrhage, especially those that occur in the kidneys, distinguish CHV infection from hepatitis and neosporosis. CHV causes serious disease only in very young puppies. The rapid death and characteristic lesions distinguish it from canine distemper.  Hemagglutination, ELISA, and immunofluorescence antibody tests are available, and PCR is highly sensitive and specific when used on fresh tissue and fluid samples. In cases of neonatal mortality, the diagnosis typically is made postmortem with virus isolation from fresh lung, liver, kidney, and spleen by cell culture techniques, followed by identification using PCR assay and sequencing, transmission electron microscopy, immunofluorescence, or fluorescence in situ hybridization. The tissues should be submitted to the laboratory refrigerated but not frozen.  Treatment of Canine Herpesvirus Infection Supportive care  The mainstay of treatment for canine herpesvirus infection is supportive care, which can include provision of each of the following:  balanced IV electrolyte solutions with or without dextrose supplementation to address dehydration, maintain volume status, and correct possible neonatal hypoglycemia  antinausea medications  supplemental oxygen  antimicrobials for possible secondary bacterial infections  active warming  supplemental nutrition  Treatment is typically unrewarding in systemically affected puppies, and the prognosis for puppies that do survive is guarded because damage to lymphoid organs, brain, kidneys, and liver may be irreparable. Before the onset of clinical signs in littermates or other nearby puppies, rearing in incubators at an increased temperature (35°C [95°F], 50% relative humidity) and/or passive immunization with intraperitoneal serum may decrease losses within an exposed litter. Limited studies with antiviral agents are inconclusive; however, any possibility of success requires immediate recognition and treatment.  Adult dogs with ocular, respiratory, or genital disease often experience mild and self-limiting clinical signs of CHV infection. Ophthalmic antivirals, such as cidofovir (0.5% every 12 hours) or trifluridine (1% every 4–6 hours), have been used successfully to treat ocular infections in adult dogs and may be useful for persistent or painful ocular lesions.  Prevention of Canine Herpesvirus Infection No vaccine against canine herpesvirus infection is currently available in the US. Previously infected bitches generally develop antibodies, and litters that follow the first infected litter receive maternal antibodies in the colostrum. Puppies that receive maternal antibodies may be infected with the virus, but disease does not result. Isolation of pregnant bitches from other dogs during the last 3 weeks of gestation and first 3 weeks postpartum, with excellent hygiene by human handlers, is the most effective way to minimize risk to puppies. Because of the high seroprevalence among adult dogs and because virus may be shed by clinically normal individuals, complete avoidance of exposure is not a reasonable management strategy for most dogs.  With regard to disinfection of veterinary and kennel premises, canine herpesvirus is sensitive to lipid solvents (such as ether and chloroform) and to most disinfectants.  Key Points Canine herpesvirus infection is a rapidly progressive and fatal multisystemic disease of neonatal puppies. It can result in lifelong latent infections and can lead to mild respiratory and ocular signs in older dogs.  Diagnosis depends on recognition of the characteristic clinical signs in an at-risk dog, followed by specific detection of the virus itself, or an immune response against the virus.  No vaccine is available in the US. Treatment is primarily supportive; after disease onset, however, the prognosis is generally poor for puppies. Prophylactic administration of immunized serum and of antiviral medications may be helpful to reduce risk of infection in exposed littermates. nfectious Canine Hepatitis ByKate E. Creevy, DVM, MS, DACVIM-SAIM, College of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A & M University; Jeremy B. Evans, DVM, Department of Small Animal Clinical Sciences, School of Veterinary Medicine & Biomedical Sciences, Texas A&M University Reviewed/Revised Nov 2022 | Modified Sept 2024 Adenoviral hepatitis in dogs results in fever, vasculitis and hepatitis, with possible sequelae of coagulopathy and subsequent immune-mediated corneal or renal effects. Most dogs recover but the disease can be fatal. Treatment is supportive; ante-mortem diagnosis is by PCR, ELISA or serology. Vaccination with modified live canine adenovirus-2 is protective against this disease caused by canine adenovirus-1, and is considered a core vaccine. Etiology and Pathogenesis | Clinical Findings | Diagnosis | Treatment | Prevention | Key Points | For More Information  Infectious canine hepatitis (ICH) due to canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1) is a worldwide, infectious disease of dogs, with clinical signs that vary from a slight fever and congestion of the mucous membranes to severe depression, marked leukopenia, and coagulation disorders. Clinical signs and laboratory abnormalities often relate to the tendency of the virus to cause hepatocellular necrosis and diffuse endothelial cell damage; however, virus-associated immune complex deposition can also lead to uveitis, corneal clouding, and glomerulonephritis. Diagnosis can be made by the use of ELISA, serologic, or PCR testing, and postmortem diagnostics include identification of intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver, PCR assay, and/or FISH of infected tissue.  Although the disease results from infection by CAV-1, administration of live, attenuated CAV-2 vaccine results in adequate protection. Supportive care is aimed at maintaining fluid balance, addressing hepatic dysfunction, managing the coagulopathic state, and treating secondary bacterial infections. The mortality rate ranges from ~10% to 30%; in some surviving dogs, however, organ disease such as hepatitis or glomerulonephritis may persist after recovery.  ICH has also been reported in foxes, wolves, coyotes, bears, lynx, and some pinnipeds; other carnivores may become infected without developing clinical illness. The disease has become uncommon in areas where routine immunization is performed; however, periodic outbreaks, which may reflect maintenance of the disease in wild and feral hosts, reinforce the need for continued vaccination.  Etiology and Pathogenesis of Infectious Canine Hepatitis Infectious canine hepatitis is due to a nonenveloped DNA virus, canine adenovirus 1 (CAV-1), which is antigenically related to CAV-2 (one of the causes of canine infectious tracheobronchitis).  Oronasal exposure to urine, feces, or saliva from infected dogs is the main route of infection. Transmission via either fomites or ectoparasites is also possible. Recovered dogs shed virus in their urine for ≥ 6 months. Initial infection occurs in the tonsillar crypts and regional lymph nodes, followed by viremia and disseminated infection. Vascular endothelial cells are the primary target; hepatic and renal parenchyma, spleen, and lungs become infected as well. Chronic kidney lesions and corneal clouding (blue eye) result from immune-complex reactions after recovery from acute or subclinical disease.  Clinical Findings of Infectious Canine Hepatitis Clinical signs of infectious canine hepatitis vary from a slight fever to peracute death. The mortality rate ranges from 10% to 30% and is typically highest in very young dogs. Concurrent parvoviral or distemper infection worsens the prognosis. The incubation period is 4–9 days. The first sign is commonly fever of > 40°C (104°F), which lasts 1–6 days and is usually biphasic. If the fever is of short duration, leukopenia may be the only other sign; if fever persists for > 1 day, however, acute illness develops.  Clinical signs may include:  nonspecific signs such as lethargy, thirst, or anorexia  conjunctivitis, serous oculonasal discharge, or corneal clouding (blue eye)  abdominal pain and vomiting, including hematemesis  signs consistent with coagulopathy or vasculitis, such as petechia of the oral mucosa  In some cases, the tonsils may be enlarged, and tachycardia out of proportion to the fever may occur. There may be subcutaneous edema of the head, neck, and trunk. Despite hepatic involvement, there is a notable absence of icterus in most acute clinical cases.  Clotting time is directly correlated with the severity of illness; vascular endothelial compromise can lead to disseminated intravascular coagulation, coupled with failure of the liver to rapidly replace consumed clotting factors. It may be difficult to control hemorrhage, which is manifested by bleeding around deciduous teeth and by spontaneous hematomas.  CNS involvement is unusual and may represent either hepatic encephalopathy or intracranial vasculitis, hemorrhage, or thrombosis. Severely infected dogs may develop seizures from forebrain damage. Paresis may result from brainstem hemorrhages, and ataxia and central blindness have also been described. Foxes more consistently have CNS signs and intermittent seizures during the course of illness, and paralysis may involve one or more limbs or the entire body. Dogs with ICH usually do not show respiratory signs; however, CAV-1 has been recovered from dogs with clinical signs of infectious tracheobronchitis.  Clinicopathologic findings reflect the coagulopathy, when present (prolonged prothrombin time, thrombocytopenia, and increased fibrin degradation products). Severely affected dogs show acute hepatocellular injury (increased ALT and AST activity). Proteinuria is common. Leukopenia typically persists throughout the febrile period. The extent of leukopenia varies and seems to be correlated with the severity of illness.  On recovery, dogs eat well but regain weight slowly. Hepatic transaminase activities peak around day 14 of infection and then decline slowly. In ~25% of recovered dogs, bilateral corneal opacity develops 7–10 days after acute clinical signs disappear, and it usually resolves spontaneously. In mild cases, transient corneal opacity may be the only clinical sign of disease.  Lesions Endothelial damage results in “paint brush” hemorrhages on the gastric serosa, lymph nodes, thymus, pancreas, and subcutaneous tissues. Hepatic cell necrosis produces a variegated color change in the liver, which may be normal in size or swollen. Histologically, there is centrilobular necrosis, with neutrophilic and monocytic infiltration, and hepatocellular intranuclear inclusions. The gallbladder wall is typically edematous and thickened; edema of the thymus may be found. Grayish white foci may be evident in the kidney cortex.  Diagnosis of Infectious Canine Hepatitis Clinical evaluation  Testing  Although clinical signs of infectious canine hepatitis can be nonspecific, any young puppy with evidence of severe hepatic dysfunction, coagulopathy or disseminated intravascular coagulation, or corneal clouding should be considered a suspect for ICH. Commercially available ELISA, serologic, and PCR tests are available to obtain an antemortem diagnosis.  Usually, the abrupt onset of illness and bleeding suggest ICH, although clinical evidence is not always sufficient to differentiate ICH from canine distemper. Definitive antemortem diagnosis is not required before supportive care is instituted; however, it can be pursued with commercially available ELISA, serologic, and PCR testing. PCR assay or restriction fragment length polymorphism is required to definitively distinguish CAV-1 from CAV-2, if clinically necessary. Postmortem gross changes in the liver and gallbladder are more conclusive, and diagnosis is confirmed by virus isolation, immunofluorescence, detection of characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies in the liver, or PCR or fluorescence in situ hybridization analysis of infected tissue.  Treatment of Infectious Canine Hepatitis Supportive care  The treatment for infectious canine hepatitis is supportive care, which includes the following goals:  to provide fluid support (balanced IV electrolyte solutions and dextrose supplementation as necessary)  to maintain adequate nutrition  to address coagulopathy (plasma and/or whole blood transfusions and/or anticoagulant therapy)  to limit secondary bacterial invasion (IV antimicrobials)  Although transient corneal opacity (which may occur during the course of ICH or may be associated with the administration of live, attenuated CAV-1 vaccines) usually requires no treatment, applying atropine ophthalmic ointment may alleviate the painful ciliary spasm sometimes associated with it. Dogs with corneal clouding should be protected against bright light. Systemic corticosteroids are contraindicated for the treatment of corneal opacity associated with ICH.  Prevention of Infectious Canine Hepatitis Injectable modified live virus (MLV) vaccines are available and are often combined with other vaccines. Vaccination against infectious canine hepatitis is recommended at the time of canine distemper vaccination. Maternal antibody from immune bitches interferes with active immunization in puppies until they are 9–12 weeks old.  Live, attenuated CAV-1 vaccines have produced transient unilateral or bilateral opacities of the cornea, and the virus may be shed in urine. For these reasons, live, attenuated CAV-2 strains, which provide cross-protection against CAV-1, are preferentially administered because they have very little tendency to produce corneal opacities or uveitis, and the virus is not shed in urine.  Historically, annual revaccination against ICH was standard, and many vaccines are labeled for annual administration. Increasing evidence suggests that immunity induced by injectable MLV CAV-1 vaccines lasts ≥ 3 years, and labels of some commercial vaccines are beginning to reflect a longer revaccination interval.  With regard to disinfection of veterinary premises and kennels, it should be noted that CAV-1 is durable in the environment, surviving outside the host for weeks or months. It is resistant to lipid solvents (such as ether), as well as to acid and formalin; however, it can be inactivated by steam cleaning or by exposure to a 1%–3% solution of sodium hypochlorite (household bleach).  Key Points Infectious canine hepatitis is a viral disease that affects young dogs and can be accompanied by a wide variety of clinical signs, ranging from fever and lethargy to hepatic failure, severe coagulopathy, and death.  Diagnosis can be obtained by ELISA, PCR assay, or serologic evaluation, but is not required before initiation of treatment, which consists mainly of supportive care.  Supportive care is aimed at maintaining nutrition and adequate fluid balance while addressing hepatic dysfunction and bleeding tendencies.  Approximately 10%–30% of affected puppies die from CAV-1; however, vaccination with MLV CAV-2 provides adequate protection.  Overview of Fungal Infections in Animals (Mycoses) ByTamara Gull, DVM, PhD, DACVM, DACVIM (LA), DACVPM, University of Missouri, Veterinary Medical Diagnostic Laboratory Reviewed ByAngel Abuelo, DVM, PhD, DABVP, DECBHM, FHEA, MRCVS, Michigan State University, College of Veterinary Medicine Reviewed/Revised Apr 2023 | Modified Sept 2024 Systemic mycoses are infections with fungal organisms that exist in the environment, enter the host from a single portal of entry, and disseminate within the host to multiple organ systems. The soil reservoir is the primary source of most infections, which can be acquired by inhalation, ingestion, or traumatic introduction of fungal elements. Certain fungi are ubiquitous; others are more regionally specific. Treatment is prolonged in all cases.  Pathogenic fungi establish infection in apparently normal hosts, and such diseases as histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis, and cryptococcosis are regarded as primary systemic mycoses. Opportunistic fungi are more likely to establish infection in an immunosuppressed host, but this is not a prerequisite to infection in animals. Prolonged administration of antimicrobials or immunosuppressive agents appears to increase the likelihood of infection by the opportunistic fungi that cause diseases such as aspergillosis and candidiasis, which may be focal or systemic.  Clinical findings, gross lesions and serology are often suggestive of systemic mycoses; however, definitive diagnosis requires microscopic identification, culture of the organism, or PCR assay. Identification of the fungus and the tissue reaction via microscopic examination of exudates and biopsy material is adequate for diagnosis of histoplasmosis, cryptococcosis, blastomycosis, coccidioidomycosis, and sporotrichosis. Other diseases, such as candidiasis, aspergillosis, phaeohyphomycosis, hyalohyphomycosis, and oomycosis (pythiosis and lagenidiosis), require more than microscopic evaluation for a definitive diagnosis.  Some fungi are commonly found as normal flora as well as contaminants of cultures; thus, tissue invasion and reaction must be demonstrated for the culture isolation to be considered noteworthy. Serologic testing may be useful for diagnosis (and prognosis) of some mycotic diseases such as coccidioidomycosis, pythiosis, and lagenidiosis. Antigen titers have proved useful for cryptococcosis, histoplasmosis, and blastomycosis.
